    "Dwight": "Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam’s desk]Don’t worry, she’s dead. Oh wait. He’s dead.I accidentally ran over it. It’s a Christmas miracle!Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?Jim.What does it look like?And circle gets the square.[to Pam] So can you watch this? I’m gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.No, Toby, this is different. He’s already dead.Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn’t want to see it killed.He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.Exactly. Thank you, Jim.Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.It’s Christmas Toby.Toby…[sighs] Please? Please?Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don’t think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.[over everybody else’s talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we’re one bathrobe short.Copy.[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It’s riddled with Carol’s name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to “Goodbye My Lover” on computer]Why don’t you just buy the whole song?Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars ’cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn’t that affect the final… How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.As ranking number three in this office, I am order –You’re number four.Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.Ok, goodOK, this is stupid.No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.Damn it!Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um… [to two other people at the table] Sir, I’m going to need take this chair.I can’t… I can’t here what you’re saying.[off screen at other end of table] What’re you talking about?[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?[off screen] What are you guys talking about?Michael! Repeat what you said louder!It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I’m here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight’s face]Who are you calling?Looks like you’ve got a little Nakiri knife action going there.Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.Nah, I don’t know… Still think Nakiri’s better.Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention][with conviction] Start the party.Jim! Jim! What… What’s happening?Oh… Narcolepsy.Oh my gosh, now she’s up.Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there’s going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don’t let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood… and the innards… and the feathers.Hey! It’s Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!No. It was awful. I couldn’t hear anything. [cheers from other party]No… way! Yeah!Oh.Walkie-talkies.Yes![into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed…[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pumBye Pam.[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] “You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.” Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away][from across the table] Where’s Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?",
    "Pam": "Merry Christ–[looks up] NO! Why… why did you bring that here?Dwight, what uh…Well, get it out of here.I would like it off my desk.Can I help you, Michael?It’s behind you.Michael?[hands over bag] I didn’t, it’s from corporate.Yup.Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I’ll just tell you.For the past few months I’ve been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]They’re considering him for a top secret mission. There’s his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he’d never ever tell.So… here’s the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn’t wrap it.Oh.Oh yeah.No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]Michael, what’s going on?I know.OK, well, why are you laying like that?Like what?Well.. um I, I don’t…I don’t need to know.No, thank you.I feel like I’ve been kinda cold to Karen and there’s no real reason for it. I mean it’s not like she’s ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn’t be cold to her.Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.Um, usually like that.I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.That could really be fun.You guys do a raffle?There is now. We just started it.What’s ours again?Oh right.Right, and if you’re interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela’s flyer.]You can’t do that.That’s a great idea.You can have your snack in here.If you’re using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you’re doing it wrong.Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.Oh yeah, your mom would love that.Bye.Oh, yeah… Maybe.Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So… you can come by… .Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]We have vodka!I got goose bumps.What?Can I talk to you a second?[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.Yeah, but we don’t have a power cord.Mmm. Hmm.We’ll go tell everyone.Night.We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.It costs seventy five dollars.Ohh… [laughs]",
    "Jim": "Merry Christmas Dwight.Wow. What have we got here?Dead goose.All right.Wow. Win-Win.Wow. What kind of bike is that?But the paint’s chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you’re supposed to put a toythe box, Creed.[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.It’s a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael’s a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?What?Are you serious?[Opens folder and reads from Dwight’s file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don’t think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?No, because of the promotion.It just feels a little bit, like…I feel like there’s a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then … what am I doing?Will they still air ‘Rudolph?’Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that’s what you want, right?OK, I think I can help here.As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I’m in session. I’ve determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]Permission denied.OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.Yes.No, it’s not.Oh, [points to Cindy] she’s asleep.Probably.And she’s trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she’s having trouble coming up with it.Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm… OK, it’s pretty much the same thing.I’m sure they’ll want to meet her, too.All right [high fives Kevin]What a horrible, horrible movie that was.Thank you.No. She wasn’t.Well, for starters, I’ve known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.Sorry.You what?Yeah.You just had a rebound.Yeah. Which, don’t get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it’s over, you’re left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.Oh no, that would be great.Hmm… Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?So, really, you’re just calling her?",
    "Toby": "Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.Dwight, you cannot keep that here.Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.It’s a dead animal in an office. You can’t…I’m sorry.Clean it in your car.Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?Hey Kev.Angela, what do you want me to do?[sighing] Look, it’s a free country. If she wants to throw a party……using her own money……then she should be allowed to.The more the merrier.Oww.That really hurt. I’m writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?",
    "Phyllis": "I like goose. If it’s already dead is it so crazy we eat it?But we invited guests.I thought you said green was whorish.It’ll be all right.You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]I was just getting a snack.OK.Hi.Oh, ok.Cold, huh?Maybe that’ll help. Is it cold in there?[under her breath] There’s another party in the break room.Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?Sugarplum fairy wands.I’ll just go get a ginger ale.",
    "Creed": "That’s crazy. It’s crazy.And a happy holiday to you.[singing] Spinnin’ n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don’t touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I’m crazy about ‘ya…I don’t care which party I go to. Once you’ve danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.",
    "Michael": "[Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] ‘Tis the … ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint…I’m looking for the toy drive box.OK…  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it’ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.Umm… I don’t know? Average kind?Well, that is probably from the test drive.No.Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn’t have to do that.OK. Did everybody get one of these?Terrific. Good.This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I’ve got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we’re leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You’re about five hours early to the party. You’re such a blonde. [laughs]Hey, everybody. I don’t know who you haven’t met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend – Carol. This is just the front of her. Show ’em, show ’em the other side.Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]No, you get outta here.Yes.Thank you.Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.That is my Christmas card. It’s a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.I know.Right.Yes, but what you didn’t realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart…And next to your kids. What?I don’t understand?OKNo, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you’re not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica’s largest fresh water pool.I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.And it’s all inclusive.Yes.No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.I’d like everybody’s attention. Christmas is canceled.Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year’s.Jim, take New Year’s away from Stanley.Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don’t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?And not that you didn’t want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I’m referring to?Take it from Toby.Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?It’s all… [Pam walks away.] OK.What are you doing? [“Goodbye My Lover” by James Blunt plays]Carol?I don’t have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just… I just want a little taste of it.[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.Hooters?Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael’s office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C’mon, we’re going to Asian Hooters.Why not?Ok, feel better.C’mon Jim, let’s go.Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then … and then suddenly she’s not yo’ ho no mo’.Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They’re on a date. They look very happy.Carol used to drink lattes.She would get this little foam mustache…And I used to say “Hey, got latte?” And she’d say, that’s not funny.She totally got me. She understood that we didn’t have to laugh to enjoy —I’m already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can’t, OK, I’m gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out…I’m just gonna call her.Nothing he’s doing is cheering me up.Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]You’re right. That’s good.I don’t know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man’s plate] I see steak.Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.I don’t think… I love it![laughing] I don’t know what he’s doing.You know what we should do?We should invite them to the Christmas party.Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana’s]The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it’s yours.Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That’s what she said.Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.Oh, party in the break room! Let’s go, let’s go! Thank God! Let’s go to the break room.Shhh… Shut it! C’mon! Party.We’re going to …I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And… my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You’re  lucky you’re so darn cute.What’re you talking about?When you know, you just know.Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.It’s… it’s one of those two. [points at both]Yeah… well, it’s been hard, they’re wearing the exact same uniform. And I’ve been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.I honestly don’t see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn’t love his wife just because he’s not sure what she looks like?Hey. Where’s my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don’t know where she is. ‘Cause I’m drunk, I can’t even find her.Haha, I do! I just haven’t hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy’s arm with a black marker]Oh, good. That felt good. Let’s go. Party.Hey, hey, you. How are ya?No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and…Where do you wanna go?I… you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.You want help? OK… Merry Christmas.That waitress was the one.How can you be sure?Don’t make fun… You’re making fun of me.I guess, I didn’t know her very well. I marked her arm.I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don’t… I know, I know. I can’t believe I gave her my bike!Oh, why do I feel like crap?I had rebound? Yeah.I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn’t score and I’m not sure who’s actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn’t matter. It’s all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There’s this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won’t be disappointed. Umm, It’s all-inclusive…William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I’m paraphrasing here, “Love doth be poison.” Brilliant. And a lot of people don’t give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don’t dial Carol before I get drunk.Yeah. You know what? I am. I’m gonna call her. That’s a good idea.[on [phone] No, I don’t think I’m asking too much. I think it’s only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that… yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did?Oh, honey, here’s Stanley.He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.Sounds good. Okay, let’s go.",
    "Kevin": "The tires look pretty worn.That’s not fair.Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin’s back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]Then why are there two flyers?Right.I didn’t see where it was.I think I’ll go to Angela’s party, because that’s the party I know.I hear Angela’s party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge… Angela… double fudge… Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm…Don’t push it.You’ve got to be kidding![singing] I want you to know. That I’m happy for you. I wish nothing but…[singing] And I’m here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It’s not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.Right.Dude, you should know.I think I’ll go to Angela’s party, because that’s the party I know.",
    "Andy": "Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.MichaelIf I may say. She’s even prettier that you described her.Hey, what’s the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]Umm… I’m number three.Yeah, but I’m number three.Hey. I can’t concentrate when I know you’re in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C’mon, my treat.That’s my boy. I know the perfect place, too.No. Benihana. Much classier. But don’t worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]So she looks really hot, so I said, “You look hotter than usual today.” [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.So she looks at me right, and she goes, “I’m sorry, don’t I even know you?” After a year, aof buying lattes from her, do you believe that?No.Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We… I… May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.I think we’ll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won’t make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn’t do that to him, would you?You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell ‘ya?This drink… [in audible conversation with Michael]Cindy, Cindy.I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C’mon, do it for Michael. He’s had a really long day.This is great.Now open your eyes and describe it to me.[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!What?Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.My new girlfriend.Your hands.I’ll use my hands on it.",
    "Carol": "Hi, is Michael around here?Michael.[whispers] What?Get outta here.I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael’s office.]What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]No. See, we never went on a ski trip.I went on a ski trip.Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.Michael.This is so weird.I think you’re a really sweet guy.But, um, I don’t know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don’t think things are going to work out with us.What are you talking about?Oh, no. Michael.Michael…I’m sorry.I know. [Closes door.]",
    "Stanley": "You can’t cancel a holiday.What does that mean?Fruity and delicious.I’m going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.Oh, you’re gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.",
    "Angela": "Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.No, orange is whorish.It would never work here.No.God help you.These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of “A Nutcracker Christmas.” I think you should leave.You tried this out, and it’s clearly not for you. It’s time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]This should’ve been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer][Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The “Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?” There’s no such thing as the “Committee to Plan Parties.”Well, you just can’t start a committee. You have to have funding.Two hundred dollars.No, that is not a party. There’s only one party and it’s hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o’clock.Phyllis?Pam, don’t tell her what to do! Phyllis.I have a very important announcement to make… about… your paychecks. Umm… Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in… Please stand by for a very important announcement… refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside][on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?Did Michael give you permission to do this?[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.I said you wouldn’t be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]Meredith, if you don’t come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.No, it’s an invitation.Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]I don’t back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven’t talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don’t even remember. So… yeah. I’m pretty good.Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone’s had some.You’ve got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]Where’s Dwight?Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you’re going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]You can’t have it [takes back toy] I don’t walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.Did you have fun at Benihana’s?I’ve had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela’s hand]I’m not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What’s your twenty?[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That’s fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..[singing] … Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door][singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.This is ridiculous. I… I’ve spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party… Are you even listening to me?I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?What are you…?And what…No she shouldn’t.[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.I’m sorry. It wasn’t my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that’s going on right in front of your face.Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.They’re Sugarplum fairy wands.It’s like you weren’t even at the meeting.[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela’s party]There’s no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!No, I’ve got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.",
    "Karen": "Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle … [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].Ok … um, another idea was karaoke …A Christmas drinking game …What?You’re kidding.Yeah, right? I’m so glad you said that. Because, I don’t know how those meetings usually go.Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?Right.Oh cool, yeah.Oh, thank you.Yeah, we do a raffle…What’s your funding?Umm, two hundred and one dollars.Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There’s a party that starts at three.And then there’s a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.I think that’s a really good option…He’s cute. You should date him.Yup.[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don’t think we’re taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?Hey, so what’s the status.Oh, you’re kidding me?Oh, you guys, guys, um… I’m sorry, but there’s a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs][Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]Do you like it?Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We’re gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.Angela, we’ve been hearing really great thing about uh… your brownies and we were hoping you’d consider merging into two parties.Yeah, thanks.OK.No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones’ Diary movie DVD]And now we get to remember it forever.Thank you. [Both hug]We didn’t have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.",
    "Meredith": "Yes.Is that a threat?No thanks. They’re too sweet.",
    "Kelly": "[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.What d’ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]See, I told you.

Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?Well, I didn’t get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I’m not gonna stand for that anymore.[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you’re not mean. You’re adorable. I’m so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn’t see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that’s why I think it’s in the dumpster. I’m so sorry. I’m the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan][from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.I don’t understand.[starts to cry] You don’t have to scream at me.Sometimes.[crying] Don’t dump me while I’m in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you’re so cold. I’ll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks]Who’s eating all these apples?And what are these? Are… Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren’t you supposed to eat the yolks?Do you think I should diet?No, I’m scared.Uh huh. Hold me.",
    "Ryan": "Ah man, I can’t.I’m not feeling so well. I’ve got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.

[Ryan starts walking away.][talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.I’m serious. It’ll show that we don’t care about material things.Kelly, I’m so cold!Are you having fun in this relationship?I don’t know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think…[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?Kelly.Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He’s so weird.No, you’re perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?All of a sudden?",
    "Waitress": "What can I get for ‘ya?",
    "Roy": "So I only use three?OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?OK. Are you sure I can’t use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I’ll see you guys later. [leaves room]Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]You don’t know?",
    "Chef": "No, it’s Usuba.Actually, the Usuba’s the better knife when you’re working with this quantity.",
    "Woman at bar": "I think he’d know. [Dwight and her stare at each other]",
    "Cindy": "I don’t know.I… don’t know, it has four bed rooms and a loft…",
    "Hannah": "Why would I be disappointed?[tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to crack.",
    "Man": "Excuse me.",

    "Other waitress": "Do I agree about what?What’re you talking about?",
