    "Michael": "Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?Huh?Pop quiz.Why is today a special day?Today’s a special day, because I am being honored as a… visiting… professor, special lecturer, emeritus… how did you, how did you…In business school, Kevin. Business school.A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um… and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. … Really ruined eighth grade for us.Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our… A game. What was the most inspiring thing I’ve ever said to you?Will they throw their hats, you think?A lot of times, at a… school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.Yeah, I know, I know. I’m just saying if they did throw their hats I’ve got a great line for that: “May your hats fly as high as your dreams.” … That was a pretty good line.I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you’re such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!We have fun.Campus. Brings back so many memories. … That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.I can’t hear what he’s saying, but he looks like he’s really into it.Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone’s textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have… a book… that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you’re inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be… a… thingamajig. Or a… a whosi-whatsi. Or… [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?Okay, I’m seeing some confused… faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.…And products!Well… okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.We can’t overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]…I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you’ll come back.…We don’t want them back, ’cause they’re… stupid.Nice try, how’s your Pollack-says-what index?Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?…Wait, Ryan said that?Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.David will always beat Goliath.Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators… mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we’re learning in business school?Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can’t you understand that? No, you can’t. You’re too young. Ryan… has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he’s a tease. Well you know what? He doesn’t know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!Business is always personal. It’s the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.You heard me, pack your things.Fire you? No, no no. You are moving… to the annex.A good manager doesn’t fire people. He hires people and inspires people. … People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.Pam-casso! Sorry I’m late, I had to race across town.Wow! You did these… freehand?My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] … How much?I don’t see a… price.Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there’s my… window, and there’s my car! That your car?That is our building… and we sell paper. … I am really proud of you.What?…Chunky. Do you want half?Okay.It is… a message. It is an inspiration, it is… a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can’t do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.Wow! That’s a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.So no?Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I’ve kept a diary of all my sales.No, it’s just mileage mostly, but there’s one chapter that I call wisdoms. I’m going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.Don’t do what I say, say what I do.Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.This… You know this is a scale of one to ten?OK. Do you want me to repeat that?Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.That’s, yep a little flimsy. Umm… OK… Ahh… Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple… [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.Lets try a little… Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You’re it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise…ses. Umm, let me ask you this:How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on… rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.OK.Very good.OK.Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time… Yes.How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.",
    "Kevin": "My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.I almost died. I… I went into this skid—…What?I almost died.Wow.[locks bat in break room] I… am a hero!Your name looks really nice.",
    "Ryan": "You will be a guest speaker… in my Emerging Enterprises class.If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So… I’d be stupidto do it, right?What?Y-You understand nobody’s graduating.…It doesn’t apply.Quit it!…Dunder-Mifflin can’t compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off…And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.Michael.What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.…It wasn’t personal.Pack my–?Look, I’m sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and… of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don’t have to fire me.To the annex? Where… Kelly is?It’s only temporary, okay? Don’t get excited.Michael it’s not… It’s not…",
    "Dwight": "“Don’t be an idiot.” Changed my life.Whenever I’m about to do something, I think, “Would an idiot do that?” And if they would, I do not do that thing.…Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]Solving a mystery, if that’s quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo–BAT! BAAAT! BAT!BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!We have… a bat… in the office.At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.What? What’s so wierd?[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.No… no. One crisis at a time.If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a “sylvania.” Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn’t mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.I don’t have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor’s dog.Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance––to use sudden violence.Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?Flush him towards the door. On my go… NOW!Animal control? I’ve been controlling animals since I was six.Goodbye Jim. And good luck.Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith’s head]Hold still, woman!…[captures bat in bag] … You’re welcome.BAT!What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder… What an ignoramous.You want rabies? Be my guest.",
    "Roy": "I can’t for your art show tonight.I-I wouldn’t miss it for the world.Love ya.Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?How ’bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That’s… pretty cool, huh?It’s cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.To my place?Your art.. was the prettiest art of… all art.",
    "Pam": "Okay, just so you know, it’s just the students from my class in a little studio.Thanks.I’m really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. … Is that braggy? I don’t mean it to be braggy.You too.Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.I mean, it’s not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.Dwight, what are you doing?Oh! No, you should go.…And it’s all from the same series.Called ‘Impressions.’Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.I hope so.I still need… you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?Hey, Kenny.Yeah, I’ll just, I’ll drive myself home.Maybe, I’m a little tired.Thank you.Oh, Michael.Yep.What do you mean?Um… you wanna buy it?Uh-huh.[hugs Michael] … Thank you.Do you have something in your pocket?No thank you.[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.Yeah, that’d be nice.Yeah that seems fair.",

So wierd…The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There’s no mark. I feel so… tingly… so strangely powerful… [shrugs] Oh well.Ow!That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It’s white hot.What? … No. It burned me. I… bizarre.Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.The glare off Angela’s crucifix? It’s blinding.So… you’re cool to just wait here for animal control?Cool. Okay. I’m gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades… there’s just so much sun in here… bye Dwight.OK, here we go… Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.Those are the books that sum up the other books.What are you reading?Oh, that could be interesting.[clears throat] I am ready.Five.Hmm… Five.Yeah.No, I got it.",
    "Kelly": "I can’t believe you’re back together with Roy!Oh my God. You’re so in love now.Oh, art show!…Oh… yeah. Definitely… I’ll be there. For sure.What are you doing? You’d better not hurt that little bat.Don’t hurt that bat, Creed! It’s a living thing with feelings and a family!AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God…I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t…Hope she’s OK.You prayed for this?",

    "Karen": "Oh my God!Oh, what happened?But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.Hey Jim, here’s the aspirin you wanted.What glare?[Karen sees Pam’s art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]",
    "Stanley": "Goooood bye.She’s on her honeymoon. She won’t be back for six weeks.",
    "Angela": "[on ground] … Please don’t let that stupid thing near me…Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!Don’t Meredith.Just goes to show the power of prayer.In a general sense.",
    "Toby": "The simple solution would be to open a window… if we had… windows that could open.Oh, this looks great. I’d, I’d love to be there, but my daughter’s play is tonight. … Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.Well, it’s important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.",
    "Business Student #1": "Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?By your own employee’s calculation you’ll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.But there’s five Goliaths, there’s… Staples, Officemax…But in the big picture…",
    "Creed": "Sure.Okay.What size?Animals can’t feel pain.Good night, Mary Beth![motions to phyllis’s desk]I’ll wait. [sighs]Goodnight Mary-Beth.",
    "Business Student #2": "What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?Has anyone ever come back?But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?",
    "Business Student #3": "How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?…What?",

    "Kenny": "Hey Pam.So cool you’re back with Roy. Maybe we can rent that cabin on the lake again this summer.There’ll be two of you and only one of me this time, since Denise left me. So I think it’s fair I only pay a third.",
    "Oscar": "You’re the one who said we needed more culture.It’s her first try.Meaning what?Well, those aren’t Pam’s strong points.You know I don’t like to participate in the…Really, it’s just that I don’t like to participate…It’s just… I’m sorry… It’s gossip, and I don’t think it’s healthy.Well, I’m not going to get over myself… it’s wrong.[laughs] That’s disgusting.",
    "Gil": "This is culture to you?Yeah, on Van Gogh’s first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.Yeah, exactly. That’s why this is… motel art.",
