    "Pam": "[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there’s anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave…  Yeah, I’m pregnant…  Great, well, I’ll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.Kevin, you’re such a gourmand.Hmm.Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?No, no.  I still have time.I’m having contractions, but they’re irregular and far apart.  So I’m not really in labor, I’m near labor.If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.I cannot wait for that joke to be over.Ooh.You know the baby’s not going to live here, right?Okay, okay, we’re not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.Everything’s fine.  We have plenty of time.Hold on, hold on.  It isn’t midnight yet.No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.I’m going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.Five minutes apart.Okay, stop watching me.Mm-hmm.Not until midnight.Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don’t think I’m going to make it until midnight if I’m just sitting here thinking about it.Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.Oh, thanks, Kelly.Yes, this is the only time I’m ever going to make this request.Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you’re really distracting me from my distractions.Why don’t you go do some work?I know, you don’t like to be frazzled.Okay.Hey.  I’m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you’ll try to drive me to the hospital.Okay, Jim.Everything is fine.  You don’t have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She’s not coming out for a while, okay?I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn’t wait…  Oh, God, don’t be mad.Mm-hmm.I know.Good.Okay.Oh, yeah, my water broke.[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.No, not yet, Michael.Oh, wow, it’s almost time for ultra feast!  Where’s Kevin?There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I’ll get there.  And if I don’t get there, I don’t get there.Mm-hmm.  Yes, I’m fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it’s still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.Nope.  No, no, that’s better.  That wasn’t even the worst of them.  I’m fine.They’re not that bad still, babe.No, it’s passing, it’s fine.  It’s okay.No, it’s passing, it’s fine.Ah, no, it passed.  It’s good.Okay, I’m not going.  I’m not…  It’s fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I’m not going today because I can’t do it, I don’t think I can do it.Oh, God.  Oh, no.Jim, we waited too long!I don’t want to have my baby here.The hospital.A baby.Dwight, get away!Michael!Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.Wait, wait.  My iPod’s not in here!It has the birth song on it!Jim, I don’t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.I don’t know!  Let’s go by the house and get it.  It’s only twenty minutes past the hospital!Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it’s on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under…Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it’s under the…Dwight just listen!  It’s underneath…  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]Yes.No, Jim, stay!Okay.This is happening!Oh, my God.[with Jim, holding the baby]  She’s incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?Okay.Oh, thank God.  I haven’t had caffeine in nine months.Okay.Love you, mom.Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.Again, no pants.Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?Good.Doesn’t she sleep here?[as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.One, and then wrap around.  It’s okay.  Hold that arm down.She’s not gonna…  Just…Go.I don’t know.  I just, I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.Doesn’t feel right.How does one do that?Do you want to try it, Jim?I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.  It just doesn’t really feel right.Even if she’s not getting anything?No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.She’s just, she’s really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.Maybe it’ll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.I know.Yes?Um, yeah, that would be great.So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch…Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can’t tell if I’m really producing.  I don’t know if she’s getting anything.Okay.Okay.No, I mean, it feels…  pressure.No.  It just feels like pressure.Okay.  So, I’m just not sure if I’m releasing, though.  I’m not sure if…Okay.  Aw, thank you.Okay.Oh, shoot.Shoot, she fell off.Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it’d be weird if you did it.[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay…  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.Oh, my God.  I didn’t even have to do the “C thing.”Aw, we’re doing it.We’re really parents now.Oh, hey, Isabelle.Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she’s totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don’t want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety…  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.Oh, my gosh.No, not at all.Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won’t latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di…Okay, please hurry.Oh, yeah, sorry.Okay, alright, thanks…  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay…  Okay, let me…  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go…  Yeah…  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.Hi.  We did it.I used a variation of your move.",
    "Dwight": "Wait a minute!  You can’t do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably![on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? …  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it’s just horrific.  The  doctor says he’d never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.I need a baby.  I’ll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I’ve been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.Ha, nerd.[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything…  Very well.  Let’s meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.Have a seat.Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.It’s been a long time since we’ve come down here separately.Now, then.  Let’s get to it, shall we?  Item one:[speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?Acceptable names include and are limited to:Ebenezer.Jonas.Warf.Okay.  Fine.Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.Yes you can.It’s as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous![as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] “We” don’t.Doesn’t matter.  I’ll escort you!Let’s go![as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!This is where I saw that deer last week.Right over by that fence.Let’s go!I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let’s move!  …  What?Are you kidding me?Dwight Schrute.Why didn’t you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM’ing you how bored I was.I don’t need a key.No, no, don’t, don’t tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam’s house to find Pam’s iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn’t find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night’s sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets…  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].[on the phone]  Hey, what’s up, kid?Nothing left to do except dot the I’s, the J’s, and the umlauts.  Why don’t you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?Very well.Isabelle.  Hello…  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so…Yup.Oh, it’s…  In the backyard.  I’ll take this.Hey, listen.  I know that I’m an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.Alright.  I’ll call you, kid.Two forms of ID, please.Nothing.Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick…  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn’t find the iPod…  Give me a couple days.  I’ll be out of your hair.",
    "Jim": "[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I’m excited.  Oh, definitely.Yeah, we’re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.Not to mention the extra night’s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it’s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it’s a boy.Michael.Michael, you shouldn’t have done that.Hmm, that logic’s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn’t conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.Because the insurance company only covers two nights.[after Pam has another contraction]  That’s seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.Are you serious?  Pam.I…  Pam, please.Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we’re calling an audible, because that’s her call.  Because she’s the quarterback.  I’m just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that’s a big deal.  While we’re on the subject, why don’t I just run you down to the hospital and we’ll just do a quick check?You know, it’s getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day’s not out yet.[as Andy and Kevin shout “yeah!” in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body’s signals.[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That’s a good one.Okay, you know what?  I’m going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He’d probably know…Alright.Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let’s go to the hospital.  Pam, let’s go to the hospital right now.Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.No, I don’t.Oh, and by the way, hate that you’re helping her with this right now.  Totally.I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she’s gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I’m crazy.  But I’m not crazy, she’s crazy.  I’m not crazy, she’s crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.Ah, you know me too well.Yeah?  …  Oh.Did you say “she?”Mad?  How could I be mad?  We’re having a little girl.Wow, we’re having a little girl.  Oh, man.Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.Yeah.Alright…  Hey, did you change?Oh.  Oh…Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.Let’s give it a shot.Hey, come on.  Let’s go to the hospital.Pam, Pam, it’s time.  Let’s go to the hospital.Come on, Michael says we should go now.Pam.You know what?  Let’s go.  We got to go to the hospital.Hey, are you kidding me?If anyone can do this, you can do this.Pam, I’m scared.  I’m real scared.The best news is, we’re going to have a baby today.A really awesome baby.So let’s have it at the hospital.How are we doing on contractions?Two minutes…Michael, I told you.No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn’t do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?Alright, we’re driving ourselves, actually.Alright, I have my wallet.Go bag’s in the car…  Keys, my keys, where’s my keys?Okay, I can’t find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found ’em.  They’re here.Okay, Michael!  Focus!Alright, here we go!  You’re doing great!  She’ll be here soon.Michael, come on!Okay.Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We’ll be fine.Okay, so what do you want to do?Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We’re going to the hospital now.Wait, you alright?Michael, just go park the car.Pam’s doing great.  Uh, she’s ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she’s also fully faced.  Which I don’t know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It’s only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.Okay.[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.No, don’t push.  Pull.  Pull.Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she’s so beautiful!  Oh, my God.No, let’s let her rest.  I’m sure there’s still twelve on each.Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.She’s seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.Hey, grandma’s back.Great.Oh.  Let me get it.I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.Ready?It’s so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.We were just kids.  What did we know?Great.I think we’ll be okay.Ready?  One, two, three…I can’t.  She’s too strong.  She’s, careful, though.  You don’t want to break it.I got it.  Alright.Nurse!How you doing?Really?Well, you’re pushing the milk out, right?Wasn’t it…  It’s kinda like a…  Like that.I think you’re good.  Doing a good job.Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.Alright.It’s going to be alright.Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.Oh, hi.Careful…  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.You see that?  I’m pretty sure she’s…  Hi.[Dwight and friends continue to destroy the Halperts’ kitchen with hammers]Yup.  Really great.  When’s she available?Are you sure it doesn’t hurt?Yup.Yeah.Perfect.I think she will.We’ll figure it out.Thank you.Please do.What?Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.Okay, I’ll just go get the other guy.Hmm?That’s amazing.That’s awesome.that’s great.Mm-hmm.Hey.What?Okay, okay.Perfect.Ha ha ha.We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?Half hour.Yes, car seat’s right there.Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be…  Can we get a late checkout?  I don’t…  I don’t think she heard me.Are you really sure we should be leaving?But you hear the baby crying, right?Uh, it’s in the lot.Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.Five tickets on the windshield…  Hey.You used my move, didn’t you?",
    "Kevin": "I cooked my way through Julia Childs’ cookbook, and now, I’m halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward’s corn flake chicken.Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we’ve been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.I think it should be a surprise.For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.Stick spicy food up her butt.Our ultra feast menu’s theme:Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I…  Are you okay?I’m petrified.[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!Yes!Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.Erin, would you have lunch with me?Yes!Bye.Hi.She touched my shoulder.No.Yes.Hi.Yeah, me too.Really, really fun.Yeah, me too.Yeah.Yeah.You said she liked me.I’ve dumped better than Erin.Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.",
    "Meredith": "[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?I have a shirt like that in my car.Hey, it’s 5:00!She hasn’t popped yet.You know it.  I am never getting married.Like Clooney.",
    "Michael": "Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She’s contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car…Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don’t want to know.  Tell me later.  Let’s go!  Let’s go!  Hospital!Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don’t get revenge on me, nerd.No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can’t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let’s go!Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam’s mind off of what’s going on inside of her body.I will allow that.Okay.Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?Yes, Phyl?[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don’t think anybody wants to see that.[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or…?  Okay.[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let’s have happy times.Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I’m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.Okay, nobody touch Pam’s nipples.  Think of Pam’s nipples as Toby’s grundle.Okay, yeah, why don’t you go get it?Okay, the opposite of that?Ooh, someone’s freakin’.I think he is.Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it’s time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn’t have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?We can do…Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?What is October feast?Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it’s time to go to the hospital.That’s right, let’s do this.Let’s go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.Are you kidding?You can do this.  You can do this.I’m scared, too.Yeah.We’re going to have a baby.Let’s do that.Two minutes apart.It’s okay.I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.We’re okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?You’re not going to.  You know where you’re going?Yes, you are.  And you know what you’re going to have?Yes!  We’re going to the hospital and we’re going to have a baby.I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it’s go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.Yes.Go bag! Where’s my go bag?  Where’s my go bag?You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.Thank you!  Wish me luck![entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We’re going now!No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.Dwight, what is the traffic like?Alright.Geesh, Dwight!What!?Where?By the bushes?Okay, go, go, go, go!Okay, just breathe…  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.Yeah?I’m texting about you, okay!?Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.Okay.Okay.Do you have everything, guys?Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]Dunder-Mifflin.  It’s okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I’m going to go wash my eyes.That kid’s going to have a lot of hair.I think it’s going to be any minute now.Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna…You’re starting, you’re kinda losing them.[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that’s right.  It’s a baby, see?Okay.  You can’t smoke anywhere these days.Guys, guys!Eleven pounds…Thank you!  Thank you!Where’s the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.Love you, as a friend.Ooh, I want to hold the baby!Alright.Oh, okay.Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.Who else here is single?I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don’t have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you’re obviously single.Andrew, what about you?Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop ’em in your mouth.  Why don’t you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?Good!Sure.  Kevin, please leave.Bye.Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.I’m not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.No, Kevin doesn’t have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won’t kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him…  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.Just don’t let him sit on you…  I’m kidding.  You’ll have fun.  It’ll be good.  It’ll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I’m surprised that you didn’t question me in the first place.No.Lynn was as hot as Erin.This isn’t about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you…  Yes, Andy?Kev…  Nice.  Going.[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today…  I think I’m going to be sick…",
    "Erin": "Ooh, spooky.  But why?I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.[naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Whirlaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox…  And…  I know this.  Uh…  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.Um, stimulate the nipples.Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We’re already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.There’s nothing in it.I didn’t know we had a tape measure.[in Michael’s office]  You wanted to see me?Oh, boy!  …  What’s that sound?I don’t know what to say.Okay.Michael, could I talk to you privately?I’m so sorry if I gave you the impression I’m into Kevin, but I’m not.  I like Andy.I’m sure he’ll be fine.Really?I don’t want anyone to die.Hi.Did you grow up around here?So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?Hey.I have really enjoyed our time together.I want to continue working on our friendship.Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.And, you’re my friend.And I hope that I’m your friend…  And, maybe…Well…Okay, good.It’s busy.  Why don’t I keep trying, and then I’ll give you the confirmation in a bit?[tearing up]  You can’t talk to me like that.  I didn’t do anything wrong.  I’ve been having a tough day today.You read the fax.Oh, my God.  That’s amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I’ll check my planner.Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?Everyday is fine.  Or…Thursday?Okay.",
    "Nick": "Well, you don’t want to wait too long, Pam.  Otherwise the baby’s going to become a teenager in there and you’ll be up all night, from the rock music.Good luck, Pam!",
    "Angela": "[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?Excuse me?Good afternoon.What is this?Of course.You know I was thinking…Agreed.Jedediah.Jedediah.No Star Trek names.What if it’s a girl?Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can’t put that in here.No.Absolutely not.Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I’ve prepared for you?I look forward to it.Goodbye.And now you, two forms of ID, please…  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature…  What is it?Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?",
    "Kelly": "Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don’t work, and you can poop yourself.Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.I’m not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan’s arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he’s single]",
    "Andy": "Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby’s born tomorrow, he’s going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don’t get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.Can we do sleight of hand tricks?Yes!  Can anyone do those?I can do the evolution of dance-dance.Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay…  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You’re clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I’m going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.A little frazzled.Hey, have you guys seen her?What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today’s paper.This man has a gift!Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.Yes, I’m going to ask out Erin.  I’m just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I’d like for the moon to be visible.Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like “Oh, this guy’s going to fail this class,” or, “What’s this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?”  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, “Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.” …  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and…  I was jealous.[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It’s really important, so I’m going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.The fax says “Erin, will you have dinner with me?” from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.Sorry, that’s unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you’re fired.Oh, God, no.  I’m…  Just read the fax.I’m…  I’m asking you out.So, it’s a date.Yeah, what day?  What day?Well, that, what’s that one?Okay.  Let’s do it.",
    "Stanley": "I’m going to go look at the Internet.Hold it!Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?",
    "Phyllis": "I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.No, it’s 4:35.Good luck!This is ridiculous.  We just can’t wait here.But you don’t know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.I have an ice cream cake in the car.",
    "Ryan": "[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  “You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.”Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.",
    "Oscar": "That’s fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!Congratulations.  That’s great.",
    "Dwight, Jim and Michael": "Here we go!",
    "Creed": "Have fun!  [sigh]",
    "Toby": "Oh, one more!",
    "Policeman": "Pull over!Pull over!  [Dwight begins throwing various weapons out of the window]  You’re not allowed to impersonate a police officer!  Don’t make this difficult, Dwight!",
    "Hospital employee": "Sir!  You can’t park here!Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?Hi.  I’m Clark.  Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.Yeah.Mm-hmm…  Where’s your car?Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.",
    "Nurse": "Daddy?  She’s ready to push.Why don’t you get more ice chips?How we doing?Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You’ve been through a lot.Okay, great.Somebody buzzed?Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.Yeah, she’ll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we’re in the nursery.Oh, good.  You know everything.Well, I’ll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?Alright.Hey, guys.  We’re short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.How’s it going?Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?Yeah, you can.  It’s 2:35.Twenty five minutes.  And you’re all set with the car seat?That bottom part needs to go in the car.Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.",
    "Doctor": "Not yet.Okay.  Really push this time, Pam.Sir!  Sir, you can’t smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out.",
    "Everyone": "Yeah!",
    "(Pam’s mom) Heleen": "Hi there.",
    "Helene": "Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.Hello, Michael.I’m, uh…  You know I think, uh, I think it’s time for me to go.Love you.",
    "Kathy": "Hi.[waking up]  Oh,has she been fussing long?I was out like a light…  Oh, she’s not hungry…",
    "Dale": "Hi, so sorry.",
    "Clark": "Actually, uh, I’m the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let’s see what we’re working with.I’ll get that for you.Okay.  Let me feel here.Yeah, it’s quite full.  Why don’t you put your hand on top of my hand.When you’re feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?Okay.Okay, well.  Feel how I’m flicking the nipple?  Like that?Stimulate it.Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh…And you can just…  The baby should grab on to that.It doesn’t…  Why don’t you bring your baby over here…  She’s beautiful.Yes, congratulations.Well, you’re doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I’ll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?",
    " Jim": "Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]",
    "Isabelle": "Knock knock.Hey.  Pam, she’s gorgeous.  Can I hold her?[entering the Halpert house]  Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?Wow, ha.  New cabinets.All I did was bring macaroni and cheese…  Where’s the fridge?Oh…  Well, I’ll let you get back to it.Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.Yeah…Do that."
