    "Michael": "Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning… well she bought the milk. It’s soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that’s what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won’t be up for a few hours.This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um… Andy and Dwight are rockin’ the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood]Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could… And she is going to be OK.Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah… people have survived far worse.Yeah.Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.Yeah, it’s only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.It was an accident.No.My lord my liege.So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.No, I was being negligent. But she’s in the hospital, she’s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in…Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so… double jeopardy, we are fine.Oh, right, I’m sorry. What is: we are fine?Ok, I have an announcement.No.No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I’m just trying to take everybody’s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.So, like a freedom tree.Pam.Pam.Ok, good good, so we’ll just all go down there together at lunch.Excellent!Good work Pam.Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don’t know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I’ll hit somebody with my car. So sue me… No, don’t sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I’m trying to make.Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh… She looks like an angel.No… OK, she always looks like that… That is not my fault.No… She’s in a coma.OK… Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.Yeah.Brought you some balloons. Why don’t we… here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes… [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh… For God’s sake!Nurse.[groaning] I am going to be sick… I’m gonna puke.Oh, OK… Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.Well, just shhhh… just just…Look, I just… I don’t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it’s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.OK, you know what? Everybody, let’s just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let’s just…Sprinkles?[sighs] Oh, sh… I’m sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then… Sprinkles! God, that’s 3 things. I’ll tell you what’s going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I’m not superstitious, but… I’m… I am a little-stitious.Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?Like park on it. Or dig up a body… Toby? Anything you want to tell us?Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.Dwight, you haven’t seen Meredith yet, have you?Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let’s just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.OK.Alright.Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.Are you sure?What are you?OK, 1 Sikh, and…You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it’s not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn’t make any sense… God is dead.Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there’s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just… the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah… the body of a porcupine.Oh God, Rabies?I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?This place is so cursed.[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith’s life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh… there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus’ dad?Pro-Am.A woman shouldn’t have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I’m hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?Come on man, gotta step it up! It’s for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.That… is for a good cause. Phyllis, how’s the rabies quilt coming?Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.Yes.OK. [walks away]Alright, alright.Shhh…I know that you’re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields… And I was a peasant.Well, you’re going to have to run, or you’re going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um… when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?Hmm… That’s a tough decision. Um… I always imagined it with a giant check. So…Yep.You didn’t contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how’s that been going?What about a rabies nurse?That’s possible. Look into that.Have you met that kid? He’s not going to college.Come in.Hey, hey, heyWhat are you doing?No I didn’t, just please don’t…May I enter the room?See how I did that. That’s the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.European offices are naked all the time.Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so…That’s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you’re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don’t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it’s not fair to people with rabies. And that’s the point, right? OK, let’s go have some fun.Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I’m Toby, I’m stretching, I know what I’m doing. Why is he even here?OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I’d like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three… too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something… Darryl what are you doing.No, don’t give him… just, did you hear anything I said?He’s happy because he’s insane. You know what, that’s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where’s the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse’s outfit] This is the reason we’re here.Oh hey, I know you… Elizabeth?Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.You got it?OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.Just remember folks, it’s not about winning, it is about finishing.[pulls Toby’s pants down] Beow!On your left!I am fast! I’m very fast! I’m like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water… solidarity!Rabies victims… have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So… least I could do.That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.[laughs] Excellent! …Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I’m getting a stitch. [groans][runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don’t get bit.[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can’t beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]I can’t finish. I feel so weak, I just…What do you want me to do Jim?No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They’re deformed, and they’re abnormal, and… they’re illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don’t have any money. Public TV is bust. I can’t do anything about it, I can’t… you know. There’s just one of me, and there’s a thousand of them. And rabies wins.That’s a good deal.Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.You just don’t think I am capable, of making a difference.You don’t, you don’t know me. You’ve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I’m the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this… GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That’s why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I’m very, very proud of that.Hey Mer. How ya doing?It’s ironic isn’t it? I mean I’m in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you’re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.Thanks, I’m not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?I’m not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I’m good.Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?Well…That’s not…That’s not what…no, no, I’m not saying that, that’s disgusting.I am saying… that… maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?Okay.Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don’t know whose fault it was.  I wasn’t exactly looking at the road.You know what, why don’t go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I’ll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.Let’s just… Why can’t you just forgive… Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren’t born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?I’m not going to leave until you forgive me.[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I’m just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.On the one hand, it’s a relief to know that it’s not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.We have to have done something wrong.That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.Oscar, are you Santaria?Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.Stupid.Yeah, the, uh, the charity’s having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That’s actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman’s Ranch with Newman’s Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make… I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won’t do it.Whoa, ‘scuse me!  Oh!Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow…Come on, I’m going backwards.Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]Thanks.Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um… I kinda wish I’d been hit by a car.Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.",
    "IT Tech Guy": "You know generally it’s not a good idea to click on offers that you haven’t requested. What was the exact offer?Yeah, what kind of video?Well if you’re going to reduce my identity to my religion then I’m Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I’m restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.",
    "Pam": "It was for a video.A celebrity sex tape.Not relevant.Not relevant.It all happened so fast.Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It’s really nice to be good friends again.And Sunday I’m thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.Cool.Well have fun with that.Thank God you were there.Oh, Michael.Hey guys, we’re all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we’re kicking in $5 for flowers.No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.Yeah, I haven’t asked him yet.I was planning on it.Angela?[to Angela] Are you coming?Can’t your other cats keep her company.Angela, you’re the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn’t even be planning this, it’s your job.OK, we’re leaving for the hospital at 1.I can take 3 people.Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we’ll sign it outside her room.Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.I…I was thinking that we…But…Michael! Michael![to Angela] It’s gonna be OK.Michael, Angela’s cat died.That’s cool.Oh me too.[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.I can help you with that.[Pam’s car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I’m not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don’t think it’s anyone’s business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it’s for real, the last person I’m gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you’ll know.Michael Scott’s Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.Pro-Am race for the… They hung up.What’s wrong?Hmm…Ah.Angela, I’m sorry.I’m more of a dog person.Well I’m gonna start fast.Then I’m gonna run fast in the middle.Then I’m gonna end fast.Cause they’re just stupid.Yeah… That was um…Yeah, I gave him a ride home because…… We’re dating.Ah, yeah. We haven’t told anybody, but it’s going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but… What do you think Michael, that’s over 25% of our funds?Giant check it is.Not well. A doctor won’t come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.I don’t think so.Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]Hey.Oh my God.You said come in!Oh my God.So I closed the door but the image of his…… dangling participle…… still burned in my eyes.[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.Yes. Or come in.On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.They’re so not.I didn’t see where it started but I saw where it ended.They say if you’re nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on… or a funny coat.What? Look, no it was not…Yeah. [laughs] Oh we’re in last place.Darn it.I don’t know I’m really committed to winning.Mmm… Yes.Yeah.[holding lamp] You like it? It’s kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?I’m still having a nice day.Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.And Michael, you don’t have rabies. And chances are you’re not going to get it anytime soon. So… you don’t really have to think about it too much.Yeah, but there’s other, better people out there who are helping.I know you Michael, I saw you naked.Michael.Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly’s cubicle]Kelly, we’re going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly’s lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?",
    "Jim": "Really, what kind of celebrity?How much did you pay for it?You paid for it?I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh… it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn’t mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh… I’m single now and looking, so if you know anybody.Oh that sounds fun. I’m mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.Yeah.What?Who was driving?One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.Oh good, so we don’t have to work.I can also take 3 people.I think she’s awake.I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t worry about it. Don’t touch it.I will do some research.Six of one, really.So what’s your strategy for this race?Mm-hmm.What?Why won’t more people do that? [laughs][looks at camera] What?[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah… No that’s not… I mean that wasn’t, ah…I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh… How it looks like um… I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um… anything.Right!Wow! There it is.It is going really great.Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.Yeah.Bat birth controlWhich we are.You know what though, I’ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.Great, it’s gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah… oh actually more with tips.Baquette.Eww.I can imagine.You couldn’t have taken off all your clothes in the men’s room?[sighs] Gross.Alright.[naked from chest up] Oh, I’m sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?Oh, would you look at that.Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that’s already been cured.That’s what I thought.Right. Let’s do some good.Oh, and I get to carry it.…talk about it.What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or…Well, you’re probably dehydrated.Glass of water would be a start.Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.You are?I’m sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?Definitely not.Conference room?",
    "Kevin": "Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they’re just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]Are you kidding me?Who’s we, you and Jim?Oh, I bet Jim goes too.Oh, I bet you ask?I bet you were.WhatWhoa![applauds][Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren’t together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they’d be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What – A – Waste!Michael?You cannot make me run.It is not a real charity. It’s stupid Michael, and I’m not gonna do it.You didn’t run for me……when I thought I had skin cancer.No.I just don’t want to run. I didn’t bring my sneakers or my clothes.Back off me.That seems early, even for her.That’d be DUI.I’ll always remember Meredith’s back.  That’s all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it’s Carrot Top, and he’s going to turn around and tell a joke.",
    "Oscar": "I don’t know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They’ve been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.So she’s really going to be fine?[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.You pushed Darryl out the window?[to Kevin] Separate cars.Like what?Dwight please!You’re doing great Michael, look at you go!More or less.There’s no proof of that.It’s fair.I was raised Catholic, but I’m agnostic now, so I guess I’m a secular humanist.Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?Oh.",
    "Dwight": "Where?No need we can just check the security tapes.It’s only Meredith.Hey… Why did you do it?Was she talkin’ back?Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?Hey monkey, what’s up?Sure.Check to see if she’s faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn’t crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.So what do you need me to do?Mm-hmm.Hey monkey.Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.Sparkles, the white one, is dead.That was the sick one, right?No.Really dead. Like a… just a dead cat.So… Hey come on, don’t be sad, just… OK… just. She’s in a better place.Actually the place that she’s in is the freezer, because of the odor.She’s only a cat.Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.No, I have not.I do not respect her, but I will go.As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we’re using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what’s unethical.Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?Pfft… Her chart doesn’t indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.Just doing my job.So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.Mm-hmm.No, no. You’ve gotta be bitten by something.Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in… Lock jaw.[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!You’re taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.[sighs] You’ll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.Well I don’t know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that’s what you told me when I contributed.Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith’s son.Mm-hmm.On your marks, get set…You’ve got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby’s coffee before the race.How ya feeling, better?Well you look cute as a button. You’ve worked up quite a sweat.I am a farmer Angela.OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don’t have the stomach to do.I… I sang her, her favorite songs.It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.Well I’m not responsible for that!Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It’s OK.It’s nothing, I’m robbing her.It’s fine. What?I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.I know a great taxidermist. I’ll pay to have her stuffed. Well he’s not great, but he’s pretty good.Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?Mmm.  [nods]My cousin Mose’s best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose’s cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That’s how you deal with a thief.",
    "Stanley": "What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?You can’t be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.Hello Meredith.I’m… um, Catholic.[on the phone] No, rabies… Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?Zero.Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.So we’ve got what, another 20 minutes?Hmmm…You ran over an employee.",
    "Andy": "Did you see who did it?Isn’t that your money?[in bathroom] I’m petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So… I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]Hey Angela. Hey, um… I’m sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]I’ve walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]Oh God! My nipples, it’s starting.[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.Ay-o!Then… what are you saying?So, how’s the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There’s a cemetery.  You think that’s affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature…",
    "Angela": "I can’t, Sprinkles is sick.She’s been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks… about Sprinkles.I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?There’s bad blood, jealousies, cliques.[sighs] All right!Hey D.Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.I have to visit the alchy.I wouldn’t put it past her.I wrote it out.There’s a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don’t shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won’t see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um… and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she’s eaten. And, oh and there’s a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you’re gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.No, that’s not. That’s next to cleanliness.Hey.Any problems?What!?Sprinkles.Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.Did she look… When you saw her how was she looking?[sobbing]Alright.[still sobbing][nods]Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn’t ready. She had so much left to accomplish.You never… you don’t like them.That’s why we’re cursed.This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.Pssst. I’m having relationship problems. And since you’re always having relationship problems, I thought you’d be able to give me some advice.I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.When I got home, Sprinkles’ body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.Something’s not right. The vet’s doing an autopsy.Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?[sighs]Shut up.Oh, really?[pushes her chair into Dwight’s legs] I’m not depressed I’m in grief.No.The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.What does that mean?You did kill her!?You put her in my freezer.Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.You! [hits Dwight]It’s OK.It’s nothing.How could you do that without telling me?Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don’t get there if you’re euthanized.You don’t understand.Don’t touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]They don’t have this kind of technology at the vet’s.  It’s not far.Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.",
