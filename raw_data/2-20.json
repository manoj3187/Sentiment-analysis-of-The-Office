    "Dwight": "Kevin Malone, you’re next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he’s eating into his mouth] Spit… Okay, come on, let’s go.Thanks, girl.Let’s go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff’s deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven’t.Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I’m going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?I didn’t know that you were at a party on Saturday night.Okay, I’m gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.Don’t make me do this the hard way.I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.I can’t stop this investigation. It is my job.I volunteered for this job.It is my duty……to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.Well, you have……because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have……and I am very proud of being a narc.Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother’s funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He’s a potential drug mule.Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?Do you think it’s possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?Have you ever… pooped… a balloon?He sure left in a hurry.I don’t want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]How do you know that?[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.No, it’s marijuana.That’s ridiculous, of course it wasn’t me.I would remember.That’s not how it works.Knock it off, okay, I’m interviewing you.[opens eyes wide in total surprise]I know you’re innocent, but I can’t look like I’m treating you any differently.Where were you yesterday after work?Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone’s urine.Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.No you can’t do that.No you cannot. It has to be official, and itto be urine.Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?Angela, what about you?You’re not onGood.Thank you, Michael.No, you will be tested.You will be. That is the law according to the rules.Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff’s deputy.Mine was green.I’m all better.What kind of filing?That goes directly to the tester.Like in a cup?For what purpose?Then I refuse.Are you serious?But that’s illegal.Not my urine.Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?I want him to have all the urine he needs.I know that. Don’t you think I know that?My father’s name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather’s name was Dwight Schrute. His father’s name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he’d wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn’t know about it. He didn’t tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.That’s great.It’s a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.Really?That’s fantastic because I’ve always felt that the security here sucked .Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?Okay, I’ll have to bring in my bow staff.[salutes] Thank you, Michael.I need to go over some details with you.First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?Oh, God.",
    "Jim": "You look cute today, Dwight.So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwightdrugs is more dangerous than most peopledrugs.[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.Whoa. You are a volunteer.And that’s not the same.[interrupting] Volunteer duty.Well, your office is behind you.I’m just saying that you can’t be sure that is wasn’t you.Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don’t remember.Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?Now how do you know how it works?No! You said that I’d be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?Oh, um…[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC’ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.Oh…[mouths] C’mon![presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]Hi.How much time do you have left on your break?Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don’t get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?",
    "Kevin": "[nods] Hey…[giggling]That is so good, MichaelI’m not taking Rogaine.I’d like a magazine.I’d still like one.",
    "Pam": "[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he’ll look up at me from his desk and he’ll just be someone else. Like he’ll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that’s supposed to be Phyllis.  I can’t do it as good as he can.He does everyone in the office.Jinx! Buy me a coke.No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.Sorry, that’s not my problem.Hey guys, what’s going on?Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, “Gee, thanks, Pam.”]I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.Uh, hmmm.Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can’t for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means][placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven’t talked to you in hours and it’s been weird and I really want to know what the hell’s going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]Hey.Ten minutes.",
    "Kelly": "And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I’m so small and all I’d eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said “Is it okay if I sip it?” and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.Six.So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I’m not that kind of…We’re having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]So, I was looking so hot…",
    "Ryan": "I go to a lot of parties.I am not giving you my keys.What’s the hard way?Yeah, let’s do it that way.I don’t think Michael’s ever done drugs. I don’t know if anyone has ever offered him any.Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?Yeah.  Maybe.",
    "Michael": "Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you’re totally harshing the office mellow.[fake coughing] Narc!I wasn’t attempting to compliment you.Uuf, well…[shakes head] Okay…Why don’t you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where’s my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, ’cause I was half-baked. Smokin’ doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin’ doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who’s he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who’s in trouble?Waa… what? What are you talking about?Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don’t know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I’m sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.I can do that, it is my office.Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, “Hey, you know what, he’s right? What he’s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.”I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn’t smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?Yes it is.Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby’s urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I’m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.Really? [Jim shakes his head no]Jim it’s okay. You can t… [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It’s okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he’s doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It’s okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths “I can’t” and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.The point I’m trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don’t quite hate ’em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.Yes, I will not be.Okay, well Dwight just know that I’ve been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn’t planning on going to the bathroom and I don’t even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.Just forget it.  Just the urine.Just. I need your urine.Yes in a cup, we’re not animals, Dwight.It’s none of your business.Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.I need clean urine for the lady.Don’t think of it that way. It’s like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there’s no controlling it. It just… goesA cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.No, just look. Look. Just… just fill up the cup.Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.What’s wrong? Where’s your costume?Why?  Wha…Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I’ve decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.Yes, sir.So you wanna? Thanks.Okay.Good.No. Oh. Uh…[awkwardly salutes]Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.",
    "Oscar": "No, I have not.What are you implying?Okay. I’m done with this.So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I’d love to hear it.Is that true, Toby?You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.",
    "Phyllis": "Yes, it’s marijuana.It’s labeled.We don’t feel that way.",
    "Creed": "That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.",
    "Stanley": "Is that supposed to be me?I do not think that is funny.Hmmmpt.Where did you get these facts?They are not.No, I don’t. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.",
    "Pam/Jim": "[in unison] I do not think that is funny.",
    "Angela": "I understand.[smiles knowingly]I don’t take any prescription drugs.[Gives Dwight a knowing look]No, not at all.Do you want to give Michael your urine?You’re not going to get my permission on this.",
    "Toby": "Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.No it’s not. It’s a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.You can’t do that.That’s not random.",
    "Linda": "We test a lot of urine.Oh, right. How are you?Yeah, we do testing all over the country.You want to work at the urinalysis lab?We just need urine, sir.",
    "Hank": "Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.Here’s your badge.No, I don’t have a gun.I don’t think so.Two."
