    "Kelly": "Michael get to the good part.So that is why I have to leave at 5:00 on Tuesday, it’s to pick up my little sisters from school.  We’re really tight. We’re like the Kardashians..Yeah I don’t like talking… [knock on door]Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don’t you just…So you should be heading back to your desk.She’s such a special person.  And she’s turning 50 this year.",
    "Oscar": "At least he is in the building.I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream… so…That’s a lot.[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]You put a note in my food?Just to say “sterile” doesn’t make it so.Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don’t make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don’t cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?Five years?It’s just not prudent Michael.I can’t believe this is really happening.And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]",
    "Everyone": "[groans]",
    "Pam": "He finally has a story everyone wants to hear… and he knows it.Okay focus. Focus.  You’re in the right building, you’re with the right people; what happened?Do you have any leads on a job?Hi.Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It’ll be a few minutes.Hmm?I’m working on it Kev.It’ll be ready soon.Is that what ‘soon’ means to you?Then come back soon.During the course of business, a copier goes though something called ‘Normal wear and tear.’Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn’t set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]No, I’m sure they’re pretty much the same as the English instructions.That’s a really… well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?Hmm…Like Michael Scott Paper Company?Hmm… yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  ‘Cause it’s a pretty big risk.Yeah… you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.Yeah. Good.Mmm-hmmEveryone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you’ve all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]Meredith…  [copier has an error] Oh… so uh… G-44.  It’s not ready Kevin!I’m at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.How’s it working?Good.I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels…[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?Oh no.I’m going with him.I’m going.Michael, wait!  I’m coming with you.Yeah.Great. Uh, except, I don’t want to be a receptionist anymore.Salesman.Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so…Probably.Okay, see you later.",
    "Stanley": "Did you tell him how sick of him you were?Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?Can’t you see I’m urinating?No.No.No I didn’t.[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.",
    "Angela": "Well, wouldn’t it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn’t have any, you know, to stay trim.Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you’ll let me know.  Good bye.These are for employees only.",
    "Kevin": "That he’s wasted 15 years of your life?Michael is that scotch?Pam?When will the new copier be ready?You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.Sometimes.[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He’s a good guy.  And he’s super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He’s all the way over there.I think he’s singing.Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?But you didn’t want to start with us?Phones?",
    "Meredith": "Did you spit in his face?Little Ms. Thing wants attention.",
    "Jim": "[Michael has a ‘sticky-hand’ toy and snags a paper off Jim’s desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.You called any headhunters?Right, cause that’s what we are talking about.[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.Yeah… .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.I would prefer not to.You’re starting your own paper company?Why?Do you know the industry is in decline?Right.No, I did that before, it added nothing.Okay. [keeps eyes open]I am not gonna do this.And you are not going to, either.Here’s the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they’re set up to do that kind of thing.Hey.Nothing, just talking.I didn’t… no.I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.What?What? Pam!Pam! You can’t be serious.Still no.Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you…I’ll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.",
    "Andy": "For four more days.Hey Michael…Can I talk to you a minute?I just wanted to tell you that… Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What’s that?Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it’s a farewell…I hope I get to work with you someday again.Ah… busted. YesOh.No way!?In this climate?Ehh… [in accent] well it’s a very intriguing concept, isn’t it?  Um… hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he’s saying something.The whole office feels darker, you know?  It’s just a sad dark day.I know.",
    "Dwight": "Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.Deutsch… let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.Your own paper company.Right…What a courageous venture.Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities…Okay. So yeah.You know, I would love to put a pin in that.No.",
    "Charles": "Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.Okay.For regional manager I’ve decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.Jim.what are you doing?Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?Okay.  After you.Okay.You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.Come in…Did Michael just let anybody in his office?I am aware of the effect I have on woman.Hey Hank, You ready?Okay, Michael?I can’t pretend I haven’t seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can’t take anything.not if you’re starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank…No, no no no.  You’re done, Michael.Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.Okay, let me know if you find it.Michael get up!Michael, what are you doing?Hank?  No, I don’t need Hank Michael.So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn’t effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]",
