The correct response is, “the coffee in Peru is much hotter.”But, that’s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?Aw, heck ya!Darryl?! Darryl!You left us without saying goodbye.Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.Get upstairs, mister!Oh, god!Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl’s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we’ll get this started.We have our decision.We want to dance with you.One dance, all of us together.Absolutely.Yes!

    "Kevin": "But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard’s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.Guys.Guys.Guys.Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says “bold front” instead of “cold front”? It’s insane.Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It’s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.Whoa.That’s totally uncool.Right. Now.Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]What? I’m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.Don’t tell me what to do!No, I don’t need this! And you obviously don’t need me.Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.He’s not that smart. He doesn’t know where I hid his duck.Can’t hear you. I’m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?Phillip got this for me?That was a really cool move.Whoa.What a chubbers. Whoa.I’m losing my balance.Whoa!You wanna play with the cactus?So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we’re gonna be best friends. He’s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.Bye, Phillip. High five.Yeah.Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.Yes!I feel scared a little.",
    "Dwight": "Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they’re protecting America’s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day’s security codes. Something that’s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It’s not the KGB, but it’s a start.But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?The coffee in Paraguay is colder?Ah, much, ok.No, no. Give me the steam.It’s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I’d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!Oh, don’t worry. They’ll get got.Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check… on that later today. This is my grandmother’s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother’s buttock bullet ring.You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] OkBehind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we’ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War—Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.Welcome.Please take an agenda item.Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. “Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.” [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.I’m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.Not now! Private time!Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]Which is, of course…Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.The power source.A loyal, but bungling apostle.Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.I’d have to get some more wire and string, but it’s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?That doesn’t sound crazy, Jim. That’s the sanest thing I’ve ever heard.That means ye, Plop!We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?You’ll always have the upper hand, when you’ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.You don’t need to repeat right now, when I’m saying it.Not even close, Meredith. Come on!Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other’s minds. You’re trying to give your wife this job.No, no, no, no! You don’t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There’s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don’t have diplomatic relations.A thousand times more.[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here’s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!I know.Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-Me.Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?Smart baby. That’s the most flavorful bond.Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.[puts his grandmother’s ring away] Thank you, Esther.I need you to perform a test.On an innocent baby.Damn straight.Hey, he can handle it.Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there’s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager’s office before?Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It’s called “Schrute or Consequences.” You’re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you’re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he’s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.Door. Chair. It’s about Phillip.I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let’s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man’s closet.Very well.Yes.Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.[throws “now” beanbag at Jim] Now.Jim. I’m not kidding. I need you.I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.She’s got a ton of great qualities. She’s young, she’s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we’re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn’t technically incest.Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.Angela.[Pam hesitates but puts the DVD into the laptop to watch]Some sort of virus?Oh.[Pam starts the video; title screen reads “Beesly—You think I’ll have regrets. I asked the doc crew to help me show you why I won’t…”; highlights of Pam and Jim from the documentary play over Snow Patrol’s “Open Your Eyes”]You’re a good assistant, Jim.That’s very true. Get the hell outta here.[in bullhorn] Pull over!Move to the side of the road!Pull over![on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!Listen to me! I love you! And I don’t care that Phillip’s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!This expresses how loudly I love you.[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.I love you!What?What? Why would you say that—[excited] Get out! I’m a dad!",
    "Creed": "[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I’m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor’s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can.

    "Oscar": "Angela, someone wants you.Angela’s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it’s Angela who’s living in the closet. Hey-o.Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.Why?Hi, buddy.I can’t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.Why didn’t you pack the apple snacks?Seriously, Kevin. I’m just gonna have to go to the store.Did we ever have lunch together, just—just the two of us? You know what, I’m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino’s.Here, use my pen.He just won’t go down. It’s as if he’s excited by all this paper.[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley’s sleeping. You don’t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?Well, he’s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don’t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?Okay, I guess, it’s just that Phillip got you something.I think there’s, like, $7 left.Sure.Easy.Hey, no.No horseplay.Ok, I’ve got my—All right, Meredith.See you there.Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother’s, and I’ll meet you at Poor Richard’s in an hour.She doesn’t know I’m living with a straight woman. I don’t want to get her hopes up.Oh, my goodness.One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.",
    "Angela": "Ok, coming. Hi, baby.Daycare won’t take Phillip anymore.Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won’t forgive. So, hi.Why didn’t you pack the apple snacks?Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.Why don’t you pack it?Not now, Kevin. Can’t you see we’re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.Ok, you go to the store.Kevin, Kevin.Kevin, could you not do that?Kevin, where are you going?I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.It’s just his way of saying, “Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.”Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That’s Kevin.Okay, watch it.No, Kevin, no.Stop it.No, no!Hey. You wanted to see me?I am sorry he’s here today but I had—How thoughtful.If he is your son, that’s a great plan. But he’s not. He’s not your son.Can I go back to my desk now?Okay, bye.Are you sure you don’t want me to drop him off?All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!Dwight?Why?What do you—Dwight!

    "Andy": "Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that’s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.Yes!Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America’s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It’s a really cool show, it’s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.No!No, this is my time! You don’t belt on my time! I belt on my time.[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!Yeah.Andy. What’s yours?Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.There’s a mole?What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!I don’t know where it came from.Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.I did, I felt it.Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.What?Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?Me too. Hold my place in line.They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.Hey, what’s goin’ on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young’uns?No, it’s me, Andy!No, no, no. I’m wearing makeup.Oh, I took out my lifts.Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can’t do that. You can’t do that, we’ve all been waiting.I am going in there! Don’t—Don’t—don’t—Don’t touch me.[interrupting contestant singing “Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You’re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You’re like, my three favorite people ever.[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you’re amazing, okay? You’re obviously gonna be on the show, so it’s someone else’s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I’m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.Nope! Can’t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss’s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.That’s—that’s what—yeah. Okay, all right, well, here’s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga’s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater—Are you insane? It’s the Cornell fight song.You didn’t let me finish. That’s not fair.Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that’s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you’re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges’ reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly—Oh I can so just sit here and cry!One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.",

We are all done taking auditions.But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America’s Next A Cappella Sensa—Okay.No, you’re not, sir.Please don’t.I’m not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]",
    "Jim": "Sales form for you to sign.Aw, thanks, man.No.Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.Yeah.I will. I will.The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that’s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I’m not risking that again.He welcomes you.Your agenda-taking pleases him.Let’s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you’re expecting a fax today, please don’t yell out, “Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.” Ok? That’s nonsense.Yes, beautiful girl in the front.That’s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who’s excited?I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—My god, I’m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.Potential future nonsense.I’m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You’ve got a regional manager.Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?Exactly.Yeah, right. I mean, unless they’re willing to pass some tests.Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?Nothing.Members of the office, hear ye.Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that’s for fueling only. No savoring.He envies you.Alright.By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?985,000,000,000,017.Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.That’s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?Ew, the exact opposite, actually.Come on.Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?Do you want a corn dog?We’ll see. You are an assistant who’s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.Uncanny.An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.Yeah. It’s real. It’s the only way you’ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She’s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!Look at that form.Uncanny. [everyone applauds]You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough.What I’m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I’ve ever said.Is-The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That’s it. You look really, really good.Hey.You all right? What’s going on?Yes, I’m happy.Yeah.What?Pam.This was my decision, not yours.You didn’t force me.You did not force me to do this.I don’t know how else to tell you.Resent you?Is that really what you think?Not enough? I don’t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it’s against the rules but I’m gonna need a favor from you guys.You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?Perform a test.Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I’m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don’t worry, he’s the best in the biz.Unless you think he can’t handle it.All right.[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.Well I’ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn’t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.OK, I don’t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.Ok, um, this is… [leaves DVD with her]—I’ll be right back.What do we got?Wow! Congratulations, that’s a really big step.Right in the sweet spot. I think you’re gonna be really happy.[whistles] That’s a lot of pros.So what is the problem?I don’t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I’ve been faced with a tough decision, there’s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.Love.Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who’s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.Not as good as you.You got it.You watched it.Well, then I guess you’re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]It’s from the teapot.

What if, as they’re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, “Nice jugs”?What are you so excited about?What are you up to?Nice.Theme song from Saved by the Bell.Darryl, hey.Cool, are you coming back to say hi?Aha. How’s Athlead?Wow.He says he doesn’t want to.Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.That’s what he says.Hey.Are you happy?No, I know that you’re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.And that was fun. But what about a year from now?What about five years from now?Because I’m so glad you’re back, baby, but I’m just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you’re giving up so much.Okay.I kind of forced you to do it.Yes, I did.I’m afraid that you’re gonna resent me and I’m afraid that—This is not enough for you and I’m afraid that I’m not enough for you.He does have a gift.What is this?Go ahead.Yeah.What’s that?Thank you.",
