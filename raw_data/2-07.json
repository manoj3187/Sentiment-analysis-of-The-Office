    "Ryan": "[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I’ve got Michael’s lucky tie.Good.Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.I forget it, brutha.",
    "Jim": "No.  They’re in the conference room.So this possible client they’re talking about, actually a big deal.  It’s Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.No…We are doing worst first dates.Wait, when was this?I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael’s screenplay on Jim’s desk]Agent Michael Scarn.How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn’t really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.Do we all have our copy of “Threat Level: Midnight”, by Michael Scott?Alright, let’s get this started.  I’m gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.Oh yeah-Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.Dwight-Do you want to play-The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh… Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-That’s actually a good idea.  We’ll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?Yeah?I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I’m not a complainer.[Pam lights a candle] Wow.Nice.  That’s excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.So, I guess I’ll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.Travel.  I’ve been looking forward to it.  It’s gonna be… really nice.  Gonna find myself.Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.Jan didn’t come back for her car last night.Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?No way.Some might even say that we had our first date last night.Really.Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.Dinner and a show, if you include Michael’s movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.You’re right, we didn’t dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.Least I didn’t leave you at a high school hockey game.Oh, come on, Pam.  I-Ok, we didn’t dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it’s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?",
    "Pam": "Wait, are those Michael’s Levis?Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I’m not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that’s why he started casual Fridays.[to Ryan] I’ll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]What is going on?Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.No, they had to come back for me.Umm… it was not that long ago.Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read ’em?Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-When-Ok.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship-Sure.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.Of the FBI.What is that?Hey, uh, I have to work late.Here’s what we think happened.  Michael’s sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who’s causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn’t work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.Yeah.For the bugs.Yes… nice!  I can’t remember the last time someone made me dinner.What are you going to do with your time off?[points to Jim’s iPod] You have new music?What!?Oh, I don’t know… [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan’s cell.Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.Oh, really?Why might some say that?Uh hmm.We didn’t dance.Swaying isn’t dancing.I have some faxes to get out.",
    "Jan": "This is a projection of the county’s needs…Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals…So when we get to the Radisson, I’d like to, um-Excuse me?You had no right to do that, Michael.It said that.Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.What?Thank you.Michael, shouldn’t take more than an hour.Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?So which way is Chili’s?Oh, no, that’s alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.I know Scranton.Alright.If it’s a couple blocks away-Ok.Why would we need a signal?What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?You’re gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.Just Jan Levinson.No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?Michael.Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I’m so sorry.  Excuse me.Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?We’re in a meeting.Christian.I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.What?So-If you have a-Christian, you don’t have to listen to this.Just the one.[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can’t match.What’s the bottom line?I don’t think Christian has time for that.Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.We’d been fighting for a while-He didn’t want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.I was stupid.Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]Bye… thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!We got it!I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let’s go.Let’s go.",
    "Michael": "Wow, graphs and charts, somebody’s really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.I changed it.  To Chili’s.Radisson just gives out this vibe, “Oh, I’m doing business at the Radisson”.  It’s kind of snooty.  So.Here’s the thing. Chili’s is the new golf course.  It’s where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.Ok, let’s do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.[under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.Well…No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don’t get very much work done when I’m not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That’s not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I’m not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we’re gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn’t matter, it’s an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!Uh, I’ll drive.It’s just a couple blocks away, so… boy, you really don’t know Scranton, do you?At all!You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-Dar de dar.Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn’t moving, you might think she was dead.We should come up with a signal of some sort.Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-Well, I… it could be either of us.Yeees.Hello?  Christian?Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.No Gould?Uh, Jan, what happened?Is Gould dead?  What uh-Wow, you’re kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?When did this happen?Ok.Alright, after you.[mouths “Wow” to the camera]Awesome blossom.[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?Ok, it’s done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it’s done.I heard a-Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?Ok.Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it’s just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm… let’s see… choo choo choo.Pam, it’s Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.Yes.No.Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?First guy says “Well, I’m an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn”.  And the second guy says, “Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort”.  And the third guy says “I gotcha both beat, I’m a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe”.[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That’s delicious!  I love it!Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.That’s why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn’t have to just shout non-sense words.  That’s her fault.Did somebody say “baby back ribs”?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs][singing] Chili’s baby back ribs…Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.Oh, so you’re not gonna play?  She’s not playing.She’s not playing the game.Check please.No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?You know?It’s true.Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin’.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It’s home, you know?  I know the challenges this county’s up against.  Here’s the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don’t care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we’re all gone, they jack up the prices.It’s bad.It, you know what, it really is.Well, corporate’s gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?[waving to Christian]  See ya.We did it!Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.What!?Goin’. Ok.  Where we goin’?  Doesn’t matter.  Goin’ to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.Morning, Pam.  Hey.No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I’m, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I’m not, I don’t want to go into it at all.  It’s off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.Hello, Dwight.Who.Uh, no, no, no Gould.This is none of your affair because she is your boss-And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don’t think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question:do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don’t know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It’s, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How’s traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No. [to camera]  Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we’re gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don’t understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you’re still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  [to Jan] I think you’re, yes, why don’t you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn’t slip you something!",
    "Oscar": "She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.Ok, that’s a joke.Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?",
    "Toby": "That is unbelievable.",
    "Kelly": "Wait, not Roy.  Say it’s not your fiance. [laughs]",
    "Dwight": "Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.Ok, you guys should not be doing this.You took something that doesn’t belong to you.Brought it in here-Made copies of it-Not now!Ok, what are they?Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of “Oklahoma” in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.If it isn’t my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]Pow! Pow! Pow!Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you’re disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who’s Dwigt?D-W-I-G-H-T.Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That’s it, the end.Uh, you don’t speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael’s office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael’s window] His car’s not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who’s this?  Jan?Did you do her?Jan Levinson-Gould.Did you do her?And she is your boss.",
    "Christian": "Yes.No, not long.Thank you.Right.  Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years.  So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-Sure.It’s ok, I like jokes.Ohhh no! [laughs] Oh my God, that’s funny!  I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!Well, we are out to save money.I have time.So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.It’s not fair.You didn’t.That’s right.You were really brave!  You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.You said “World, this is my blood!  It’s red, just like yours.  So love me!”Right down the street?I know.It’s terrible.I don’t know.  I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they’re expecting me to make cuts.",
    "Hostess": "This way, please.",
    "Everyone": "Yeah, yeah.",
    "Phyllis": "That’s the character’s name?Sir, you have some messages.They’re important.First message is:“I love you”.  That’s from me.",
    "Michael and Christian": "[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-No.",
    "Roy": "[looks around conference room] You’re joking right?",
    "Kevin": "Michael’s movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh."
