What was I so busy doing?Okay well, that’s a relief!Yeah… Who’s opening?Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don’t think I can see this.How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That’s not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.Don’t call me a clown, Pam. You’re better than that!Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.",
    "Pam": "Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?Smokey, the bear?No, no, no, “Tracks of My Tears” and what else? What are some more? What’s one more?I don’t think you love Smokey Robinson.

That’s only three hours away!Tickets are 250 bucks.Paul Anka.Okay, you could just show up late though.Well, as long as you don’t want to alarm people…Wow, that’s exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.Wait, what? Come on!Okay, Oscar, I’m not saying you’re not dreamy, because you are, but isn’t it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]What happened, did he do it?Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn’t Downton Abbey.Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to go over there and I’m going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.Look at that one though, he’s smiling!Yes–Okay well, Andy, listen. It’s okay if you don’t feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?Yeah",
    "Nellie": "I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?YeahI knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I’d be murdered.[hears knocks on door.] Come in!Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.How are things in the warehouse?The warehouse isn’t downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?[speechless.] I…Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers… Or Oreos… Or a pizza pie or, what’s another food that we like?What I wouldn’t give for a big mess of tacos right now!Brilliant!Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we’d probably need about what 20… $20? Or $25? $20?$30, yes!I’ve never eaten a taco. I’m not entirely sure what they are. As long as they’re not slimy, and please god don’t let them have eyes!Oh, great! Okay, oh… Oh, these tacos!Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm… Oh! Hmmph!",
    "Dwight": "You don’t like the Beatles?Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?I don’t want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killedThere is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.That’s how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male “hanging out”. Call the cops!I don’t even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I’m going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I’m gonna bring my gym bag just in case.[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you’re going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God![on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!It’s $475! Like candy from a baby![applause] Yes! Thank you![applause] Oh yes! Yeah![applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!Thank you. Wow, I can’t tell you what an honor it is to support this thing… And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets’ remember we are all here for the dog society. He’s what’s important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]",
    "Oscar": "It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It’s on CNN as of two minutes ago.What’s going on?my dog Gerald is my life.This confirms three things: I’m right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!I know!We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?This is interesting.He does not think Jim’s gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.sorry about what? There’s nothing to be sorry about here.No. I’m certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I’d have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.Nice to see you again, it was lovely!okaywhy does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela",

[Robert extends his hand.][telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start–Well…So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?and the hero, who’s that based on?Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don’t you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?Andy you should leave. Now.Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don’t often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else willAndy, that’s very kind–Andy why don’t we discuss this at a–",
    "Angela": "Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight… I’m sure it will be fine.My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters!

[hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you![points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It’s been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What’s the question? How am I doing? Umm… Great!What haven’t I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I’m writing, though it feels more like I’m receiving it than writing it.The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that’s shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!Bobby! Bobbo! You’re a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?You gotta check out this thing I’m working on, it’s really cool. There’s this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can’t control.Evil!

That was not even a joke.I will! I will take all of those dogs!No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it’s not that complicated.No, no, no, it’s about being there for someone after it’s become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!Okay! Hope you all learned something!I’m so ready to love all of these animals.

She’s so dainty!Doesn’t really poop. It’s perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.She smells horrible. It’s unbelievable. But I don’t want to put her in the bath, because I’m afraid that she’ll drown.People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they’re just jealous, right!
