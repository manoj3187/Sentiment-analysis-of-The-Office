    "Michael": "[at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!Are we all set?Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I’d drop in and say hello.Thought I’d catch a show.Naaah. You know what? Since I’m here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.Um, how many people are you interviewing?Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?Great. One more… question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?Ah, great. No further questions.Okay.And I’m really looking forward to working with you.I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I’ll be like three hours late.[knock on door] Yeah.Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.Okay. Uh…Uh, okay.Stop crying.Ohhhhh…Why so you can do it?No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger…Moon each other.All right.Your loss.Cruise control.There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.No. Not at all. I haven’t talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.No, no, no. You know what? It’s a done deal. I basically have the job already. There’s nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.Yes, I…I have to buy another place.I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.Who is D. Abramson?Why… are you here?I’m good. How are you, Janet? It’s good to see you.Why privately?Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don’t you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.Okay.Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.No. She’s an alternate.So, how you been?Good.Yeah.Weird. Yeah, I didn’t get both of your messages.Hmm.Sound good. Sounds fun.Hmm..Would you excuse me for a second?Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.I don’t know, that’s why you’re here, help me. Please…No, no. What do I do?What if she makes me?She made me do a lot of things I didn’t wanna do.I wasn’t.You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m gonna go in there and tell her that we can’t be together.Wow.I’m in a very good place right now. Thank you.[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.Yeah.First got priorities.Let’s get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]No.  No, no, no, no.  I’ll tell you this, it isbecause of the boob job.  Excuse me, boob enhancement.  That would be shallow.  And this is the opposite of shallow.  This is… emotionally magnificent.[holding Jan’s breasts] Remarkable.Wait, wait. Check one more time.Very good [Jan nods]Yes, indeed.So, I guess we’re getting back together.Your advice was good, but Jan’s was bigger.Here’s the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn’t connect, I was miserable. Now, I’m in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I’ll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody’s names.  If you need to know somebody’s name, just ask me.is Beardy.Mm-hmm.No, no, no, just… that’s not his real name.  That’s just what I call him, so…I am by far the most qualified person they’re interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They’re like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy… is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.Hey!  Hunter!  Wha’s up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.Jan in yet?Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?Just say, “I want to squeeze them.”  It’s code.  She’ll know what it means.Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the “motorboat” noise] “Brbrbrbrbr!” also?[knocks on door] Hello, hello!Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.Why don’t I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.Well, my weaknesses are actually… strengths.Thank you.I’ve never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, “Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We’re GRRRRRRRRRREAT!”  I don’t know, could be good.  Or, uh, “Super Duper Paper.  It’s super duper.”  I don’t know, something like that.Okay.Thank you.It is always a treat whenpaths cross.  So, oh!  Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn’t already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together.  So… I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her… or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that’s not sexual, just… we’re all professionals.I don’t understand. So, we’re gonna tag team it?Hey.Pretty good.Could have gone better I guess.Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.Daaah, let’s just run away together.  Let’s just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would… be fine.  We’d have fun.I can’t tell you.Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan—Hey!unstable!No— We’re all unstable.David, I did not tell her.So, I am gonna… give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.Good, I’m glad we’re on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.You know what?  That… is actually good… because, um, I don’t think I could take… my girlfriend’s job.  That’s not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?Good.  Very good.  I’m glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.Good.  That’s all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them… excellent candidates.I know.  I know, I’m sorry about that.  That was terrible.Well, it’s… [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don’t cry, it’s gonna be OK.[whispers] I don’t know.  [normal volume] Well I guess… you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.[in the office, imitating the terminator] I’ll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!No.  No, Pam.  I’m baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  “Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.”  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?That’s stupid.You shouldn’t have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I’m baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.No, it’s for me, bimbo.  Kids.So I’m back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place… is like… the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my… graveyard… for my bones.[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin’ on that coffee.Well, [clears throat] I’ve actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it’s the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.Well, I don’t know what it’s gonna be called, but… my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future… is me.Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that… I couldn’t take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is… my home.  And home is where the hardest.Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they’d help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he’s a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so… free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.",
    "David": "[confused] Oh, Michael?Isn’t our interview tomorrow?You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?In the middle of a work day?Okay.We’re only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.I don’t think so.I believe we put you in charge.Okay, Michael.I’m really looking forward to our interview.Michael, good to see you!Oh, great.  I’ve been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn’t lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?Okay.  And your strengths?Oh.  Yes.  Very good.Very good.What do you think we could be doing better?Okay!Thanks for comin’ in, Michael.It is always a treat when our paths cross.You’re back together.Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position… the job you’re applying for… is Jan’s job.No, we’re letting Jan go.Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but……what do you think about Michael Scott?This is off the record.Jan, this isn’t the time, we’re in an interview—Frankly, it’s overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.Recently, you don’t even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you’re visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to—It’s not.It’s not.The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.Actually, Michael, I think we’re gonna take it in another direction.No, we’re not giving you the job.I do.Yes.I don’t know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You’re clearly a very bright guy.Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet—Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out……that’s a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he’s probably the only person you’re not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads “Jim, Don’t forget us when you’re famous!  Pam”  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up…How do you think you function here in New York?You’ve been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam’s note] What have you liked most about that place?Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So… long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I’m very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I’m so glad.  We’re all very excited you’re going to be joining us.  It’ll be nice to have another MBA around here.Where do you see yourself in ten years?A… multivitamin?",
    "Kevin": "[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.What’s different about you? You look worse.So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?Pam is taller.Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.I think Karen has a prettier face.Well I mean Pam’s face is really pretty too. It’s a very tough call.Yeah.Will do.Do you think it’s gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?What?Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo…I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.[raises hand] Do we have to?[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.",
    "Jim": "Hey, Kev.Thank you.Ohhh…No.No way.[exhales loudly] Andy…Nothing.Yup.Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.Thanks, Pam.Ahhh… just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let’s do it.So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early ’cause we want to spend the night in the city.Whoops.Hmmm.Ah, we’re gonna go tonight, but we’re gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?All right.Yeah, I’m not going to talk about this now.You sure?Wow.Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?Hm. Really tough call.You know what? Why don’t you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.All right. [smiles]Oh hey, Dwight.Does my room have cable?Can I change rooms?Can I have a late checkout?You’re not the manager even in your own fantasy?Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?Go.Yeah, bigger actually.Mm-hm.Unbelievable.She could put the cup right there.Thanks.Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or…Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?Oh…Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It’s in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That’s when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.Oh do you mean when I get the job?You mean Kevin?Yeah, I do. C’mon. [they hold hands and cross street][points at bearded man] Who’s that?Beardy?I’m gonna introduce myself.Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don’t have to stay, if you don’t want.Okay.Sure.Thank you.I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]Thanks.I’m sorry, wait, so is the question “How’d I get to be so awesome?” [laughs] Because, I don’t have an answer for you. [laughs]Yes, absolutely.Oh, no, absolutely.[hands David his papers] There you go.[not thinking clearly because of Pam’s note] What’s that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there’s just a [sic] energy… New York has, uh…  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that’s a… bonus.[thinks] The friendships.[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?The real reason that I went to Stamford… was because… I wanted to be… not here.And even though… I came back, I just, I feel like I’ve never really… come back.Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?All right.  Then… it’s a date.",
    "Meredith": "You got a haircut. It’s sexy, hot.Turn around.Yes.Do it!You know what? Don’t even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.",
    "Andy": "Blup-dup-do. What’s up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.What is it, Big Haircut?Sorry, I can’t hear you Big Haircut.What?[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.Saving the best for first!White, because it contains all other colors.You make a chair, but you don’t sit on it.The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn’t you say?I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.Damn it!Hail to the chief!My first order of business: accept.Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad.

Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is… my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent… [long pause] and quick on my feet.Trick question.

    "Pam": "Hey. I think it looks great.After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he’s coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.Hey.Um, about the beach…Oh, no it’s not that, I’ve actually been thinking that for a long time, and I’m glad I said it. I just… I’m sorry if it made you feel weird.Wow, very funny.[smiles]He’s from that company in Pitts…What do you want me to do?What about Meredith?So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.Uh, sure.I really hope you get the job.Just don’t get back together with her.This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.You’re so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.Right.Oh my God. [mouths to Jim][whispers] That’s crazy![mouths] Wow!No, it’s fine.  I’m sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around… that.[to Jim] Good luck.I’m happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche…  Maybe I’m being cliche.  I don’t care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That’s Popeye.What happened?Thank you.Really?You will be your own assistant.Okay.  So… you would be the Regional Manager,the Assistant Regional Manager.  Andy is your number two.  I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager.Mm-hmm.Absolutely, I do.I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret… you reply, “Absolutely, I do.”Then who do you think will get the job?[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.HEY!  COME ON!  Let’s listen to Dwight’s presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]How’d it go?Did… Karen get the job?Dwight, hello.No, I don’t know what the future holds, but… I’m optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I… are just… too similar.  Maybe one day I’ll find my own Karen. But— you— that is, a, um, you know, not— A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then… I can hold my head up. … I’m not gay.Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]I know.Well, I wish you would.[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I’ll transfer you.I haven’t heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn’t he?  He’s totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him… and, if he never comes back again… that’s OK.  We’re friends.  And I’m sure we’ll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and…  But you know what?  It’s OK.  I’m totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally— [Jim walks in]Yes.[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I’m sorry, what was the question?Mmm-hmm. [nods]Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens.

[whispers] Me. I’m taking his job.[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It’s my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.No. And the sheets are made of fire.Sorry, we’re all booked up. Hell convention in town.I’ll have to talk to the manager.I’m the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!Yeah, but I haven’t told you my salary yet.Eighty thousand dollars a year.Once I’m officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.Yes you will.Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy’s name]  Andrew Bernard.No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.What did I say!?I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?What is the capital of Maine?Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don’t wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.You’re not off to a very good start, Bernard.[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.This interview is over. I’ll let you know.[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who’s ready to work?Michael is gone.My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael’s World’s Best Boss mug]You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.I had to make Andy my number two.  It’s political, complicated, you wouldn’t understand.  I want you… to be Assistant Regional Manager.Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title… to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.Mmmmmm, let’s call it Secret Assistantthe Regional Manager.Do you accept?Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This… [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight’s face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks… equals an extra five minutes for lunch.Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.Just… zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group’s time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.Yes!  Michael is gone.  There’s a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is “me.”  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!Listen up.  Let’s start… from the ground.  Where does paper come from?Trees!  And where do trees grow?Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say… is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head “no”]  Wrong!  It’s nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous… state?Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!We— Don’t you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?What’s the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?Okay—What—No wait, what are you doing?!No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.Zip your lid!It’s like outerspace without the stars, it’s so black. [laughs]It’s so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here… is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!To intimidate my subordinates.It was Andy’s idea.Pam, hello.I wanted to thank you… for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]Define scorched earth policy.Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.Who was the second man on the moon?Inventor of the cotton gin.Talk me through an appendectomy.Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] …the wound.When is the Paleolithic Age?What is a scented candle?How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.",
    "Karen": "Hey.It’s okay, we all say things without thinking.[confused] Oh. Okay.Pam is… kind of a bitch.Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.[looks annoyed]Heh.Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?Oh.‘Cause of Jan again?Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim’s and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?Thanks.Thanks. [looks suspicious]Do you want to get back together with her?Do it.[moves to block Jim from Pam’s eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?Wow!I know!All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck![Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.Oh, you know I’m gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend’s house.No, I’m sorry I should have been clearer. It’s for me.‘Cause I’m going to get the job.So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?How often do you come here?I think you’ll really enjoy this, adult Jim.That wasn’t him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]So what’s going to happen to us when I get this job?Well,you get the job then I’d move here with you. Would you move with me?  I’m not stupid. I was at the beach.  We won’t have a future in Scranton. There’s one too many people there.Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can’t stay there.Uh, no, we’re good.  Thanks.So, that’s… my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?Yeah?He’s a very nice man.  And he’s very well suited for the job he has now.He would be disaster.Wow.  That was some serious… hardcore… self destruction.Don’t!  She’s nuts!

    "Kelly": "Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.Who was that?What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he’s boss, it’ll be really awkward.But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn’t feel the same way, and then he’ll be gone.Pam, he’s just not that into you.No, seriously Pam, wake up.",
    "Creed": "I remember. I blogged the whole thing.www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That’s how I like ’em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.",
