    "Nate": "Got it. [taking a group photo outside]One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She’s on the ground by ‘three’.Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]",
    "Pam": "Okay let’s go in. I’m freezing.Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one’s putting this on their fridge.Okay.I’m freezing.I’m the office administrator now, which means I’m basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head… I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.It hardly looks fake. It’s so lush.Great.Nope.Nashua got mp3 players.Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that…A party. It’s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.Michael, Michael, wait we don’t have, we don’t have the budget for another party.I honestly think you’re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don’t think that’s gonna happen.Hey.Yes. But don’t get too excited, ’cause I didn’t have a lot of time this year.Okay.I’ve been working forever on Jim’s present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He’ll take a memory or a private joke, and he’ll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes ‘bear man’. Wreaks havoc on the office. It’s really good.No, it has the little…Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It’s just us.Oh, do you mean Darryl? That’s a great idea. I’ll ask him.Yeah. He works here. We all know him.Cool.Hey, sorry, I really didn’t want to come in. It’s just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we’re hoping we could borrow your truck.Okay. Sorry. We’ll uh, we’ll leave you alone.Hey, how about this one?Maybe. I mean…Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it’s none of my business, but if I couldn’t have Cece for Christmas, I’d be really upset too.Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.Bring her to the party. Yeah, we’ll have Santa, and we’ll play games with her. It’ll be a lot of fun.You’ll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.Hey guys, the tree’s here.Who told you that?Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?You guys, I don’t think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.Wow, an ultimatum.It doesn’t really seem like you.So, cool right?Okay.Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?I mean, help, if it’s something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or…No.Yup.No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.Look at this.Jada, Darryl, I’m so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?Oh, my goodness.Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?Thank you.[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don’t think he’s in the ceiling, babe.Is it… is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it][lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.I love it.Oh, um, it’s just, I didn’t, I didn’t have a lot of time, so that’s just a place holder.Michael, wait!That’s good advice.That’s a sad story.Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything’s gonna be okay.I shouldn’t tell you this, but… AJ won’t commit to Holly. And she’s gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose to her by the end of the year, it’s over.Really. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?So just be patient.Hey, sorry. I’m ready.Oh… come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]I’m sorry. I had no idea.Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.What?What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!",
    "Michael": "People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We’re gonna do a fun one.That’s it! That’s a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We’re gonna jump in the air. Here we go.Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.Don’t answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we’re all in the air at the same time. Yes?I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.We didn’t get it.Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]How’s everybody doing today?How’s the party coming along?Are we over budget?No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What’s the problem?So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?Whatcha got?Well, that’s a relief. Santa’s gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that’s what I want. That’s what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.Yeah!Pam? Pam?Hi.Uh, because you’ve been on the Lam? Because the ‘boring police’ have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?That was the worst joke ever.Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.What? What?Hold on, Holly’s coming back here?That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?Holly’s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.You know what, we’ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.Cancel. We’re canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food]No, we have to cancel the party.No, no, no, we’re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.I know.It’s not. They’re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.Well then everybody’ll chip in, it’ll be fine.You know what, I’ll pay for it. I’ll pay for the party. It doesn’t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly’s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person’s breath away.We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they’ve never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond… Santa Bond. I’ll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa… wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can’t get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He’s not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus… God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael’s pants]Well, this year’s gonna be different. We’re gonna have fun. It’s not gonna be tacky. It’s going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It’s not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It’s gonna be cool, sleek Santa.Okay. Sure.You never know about the press.Could he help us with some parking tickets?Well, then he’s not a senator.Okay.Okay… [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!Pam, no, no. Holly’s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it’s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.Yes, that’s me. Come on it.[scats awkwardly] There’s nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what’s better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.She doesn’t need an internet presence, you just know.What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in the courthouse.And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God’s sake?Hello.[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I’d see your face around these parts, you old bastard.[as Curly] Why, you’re some sorta wise guy, huh?Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk![as Homer] D’oh!Hi. Hi. Oh… [they hug]Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.That’s adorable.Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.Isn’t it wonderful? We love it here. Don’t you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?This is weird. I can’t believe you’re here. This feels like you never left. Doesn’t it?Oh…Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy…Well, that’s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy’s mom.Because without Andy’s mom, there’s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.You’re kidding me. Ahh!What a douche bag!Get a… yeah! Good riddance.Mmhmm.Good for him.Really? That’s creepy. How did AJ get in your house?Oh, you do?[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman’s the best.Me too.Hey.Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I’m Santa Claus. Welcome.It’s a sophisticated take.Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don’t. And that’s just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly’s Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.I haven’t told you about her.I’m a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that’s pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, “Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.”I do. She is.Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain’t Tara.What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby’s very jealous of all the attention you’ve been getting.Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn’t that nice? Thank you very much.It is Christmas.Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?[laughs] I don’t. But someday I think we will laugh about this… when we tell our kids…All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That’s what Jim and Dwight thought.When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, “Michael, I love you, but I can’t do this.” But then, with this other guy, you don’t have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.And we did this whole stupid party for you.Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?HeyNice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.Good trip down?Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.I am dead inside.Oh, hey, hey, no, don’t run. You’re gonna slip.Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.No, it’s not. It’s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.Really?No.Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don’t want you to fall.I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.No, that’s not… no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That…Well, that…Hey.Oh.Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn’t he say that?I think I know where he is.Mmhmm.Video games.A DSi?A horse.You, are you sure you don’t want a pony? You want a real horse?All right. You have to pick up after them.",
    "Jim": "One Charlie’s Angels. One. Let’s go.You gotta be kidding me. Who isn’t jumping?Why’s it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah… good one.Hey, it’s snowing.[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]Well, it’s not a snowball, ’cause it’s only a dusting. Right?You’ve got something on your nose.No.You got it.Hey.We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.Me neither. Whew.[A note is on Jim’s computer that says, “It is time. Parking lot at noon.” Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.][standing outside, dials Dwight’s cell phone]Stop! Stop!Oh… oh!Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing ’em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then… [reading text message] “How ’bout icing it? lol. Dwight.”Okay… Holly’s back.Aww…Don’t. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!Stop!Okay. Okay. Okay.Seriously!Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]I just want it to stop.Hey, Toby.No way.That’s increadible.You know what’s crazy?I can’t reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]What are you talking about? You’re the one terrorizing me.Okay, I’m sorry, why are we discounting this whole “Woody came to life” thing so quickly?Yikes. [everyone gasps]No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] “Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.” [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!Well, uh… I don’t think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]Ooh, go easy with the shaking.You like it?Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn’t make that.Alright, my turn.Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] “The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.” Oh, my God. This is awesome! That’s my bike. That’s my desk. And that is my daughter.I mean… [speechless]I surrender.Anything. You got it.You’re a psychopath.I don’t want to go.Have you ever seen ’em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]No, it’s, it’s okay. Okay.Okay. This is it.Go! Go! Go!",
    "Kevin": "Oh, I got it, you guys, how ’bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, ‘why I oughta’, and the girls are like, ‘let’s go shopping!’.Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.Oh, right. The state senator.Oh, that would be impressive… ifknew what a comptroller was.I would, but I don’t want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.Yeah.Hi, Toby.Yeah.Did you bring us anything from Nashua?Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren’t looking. You don’t think… it’s not possible… that Woody did this to himself.Oh no, that’s, that’s not happening.Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!I bet you didn’t even bring us anything, did you?[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!Wow, that’s awesome!",
    "Andy": "Let’s just jump in the air!Well, if we all jump really high, we’ll be in the air longer. Do that.Yea?All good, Santa.Hello Kitty’s for girls.That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?Is it criminal?Have we heard of it?Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]I bought these.These cookies are fine.I will help. Although my ‘brid’, my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won’t fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.You know Darryl?I should come along, just ’cause he’s my, you know, he’s my hookup.It’s cool, Darryl, I’m here too.Come on, it’ll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won’t you be my Christmas tree.Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?I don’t have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I’m going to kill myself.Yes.Nobody hug me, I’m covered in tree sap, so…Why would anyone frame you for that?I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.Wahhh…No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?Do you know the other state?The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she’s burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada’s ear]",
    "Dwight": "I’ll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.You are?Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn’t one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.Oh come on.[mocking] Oh, my God! It’s the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It’s not even a real snow. Look, it’s a dusting. Pitiful.Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!Look at that. There’s a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.You apologize to me right now.You apologize right now.Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.No, Andy, it’s a snowball fight. It’s not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight’s hand] Jim, let go. Let go.Pam?Death to Toby!Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?Okay.[voicemail recording] You’ve reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave… [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!Ahh![grunting, shouting]I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off][turns in Pam’s chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]Oh, no. Oh, no!Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!Huh? You like that?Huh?Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.Wait, what girlfriend?I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.Dear God in heaven.Okay, hey, hey, hey…Didn’t think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.I do not accept your surrender. There’s only one way that I would ever relent.You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.I’ll take that as a no.In the end, the greatest snowball isn’t a snowball at all. It’s fear. Merry Christmas.",
    "Phyllis": "I am jumping.Yes, I’m jumping.Yeah, I don’t even have a laptop.Oh God.Oh, don’t be such a baby.What’s the case, Toby?So is it an open relationship?Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.So you went homemade this year.Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don’t think we can help you out.Are you good at homemade?Yeah…Well, I don’t think Erin seems to like you.",
    "Erin": "I didn’t want to miss it.Good.Guys, who’s Holly?Wow.I’ve looked her up online… there’s nothing about her. She’s made no impression on the internet.Oh…Hello.I’m really sorry, I can’t help you. I’m waiting for my boss’ pretty friend to arrive.Oh, you’re Holly! Of course. Sorry.To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly’s not in any position to be shooing guys away.I don’t get it! I’m sorry. I just, I don’t get it!That’s not true. I don’t know her enough to make a decision even.[blocks Holly’s path] No.I really think you’re better off.Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?Hello.I know who you are, and I think you should go.",
    "Oscar": "Here’s a question nobody’s asking:Is this worth it?Why?State senator.Who are you dating in the public arena?Well…Why would someone hug you?Senator, it’s an honor. I’m Angela’s friend Oscar.Robert seems great. He’s very handsome, firm handshake, he’s gay, good sense of humor.Merry Christmas to you.A real David and Goliath story.I’ll make it. What are you drinking.I don’t know how to make that.",
    "All": "Merry Christmas.",
    "Meredith": "Not yet!Wow.Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.That scowl.Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car… for screwing Americans.Thank you.The real problem is the teachers’ union.No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can’t read.Annoying.",
    "Angela": "Nothing. Should be fun.I wouldn’t subject Robert to that. He’s a very busy senator.I would not expect you to know what it’s like to date someone in the public arena.The senator.We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller’s wife.Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. “Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “over here, Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “here. Look here!”No, don’t throw those out!We can save that.Just stop moving your calves so much while you’re talking.Maybe I’ll bring my boyfriend. I’ll invite him.I mean, unless there’s any chance there could be press at this party.Well, I only ask because he’s a senator.I don’t think that’s appropriate.Yes, he is.It’s so cold. Even with my coat on.No, it really seems like something Michael would do.I’m so glad you could come.Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.Yes.Mmhmm.I don’t know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.I am.Zip it, Meredith.You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he’s helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they’ve really become a pest.Yes.",
    "Stanley": "[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I’m doing fine.Yeah, who’s a little girl now? [everyone laughs]So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?You lucky son of a bitch.I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for… that is the life.",
    "Kelly": "It’s present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, “Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.”It’s a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.I said, “I wonder.” I didn’t say, “I think.”Blankets, what am I, five?He’s rubbing his neck.Well, you’re almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?So where’s the ring?That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You’re re-gifting this to me.Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.This is a fast food receipt from April.God, how many number nines did you order?",
    "Gabe": "We just want to say how grateful we are.Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.Erin and I make great use of ours.Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we’re still dating?I’m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.",
    "Darryl": "I’ll take one of those pink pouches.I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It’s my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I’ve never heard of. iCarly… You know who’s funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He’s got a nice way of talking.Come on, now, Justine, look… Listen, look, I’ve been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.She did?I don’t know… I thought I was enough family for my daughter.[Pam knocks on Darryl’s door] Don’t come in, I’m busy. [Pam opens the door]Uh, no.No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.Hey… [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let’s do it.[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh… pick a damn tree already.Jada don’t want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn’t as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that’s something to do.How do I do that?Are you serious?No, he doesn’t. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.Sure, sweetie.Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he’ll tell us if we’re hot or cold.And the game’s over seconds later.What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies…Hey, Mike.We wanted to give you something.What do you say?",
    "Toby": "Hi guys.Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I’ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.Uh, no, the opposite.

You know, I don’t interrupt your announcements.Well, I really can’t talk about it, but it’s a very high profile case.Yes.I don’t know.Come on.Guys, it’s a really big deal. [rubs his neck]I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let’s just say I’ll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.Yeah, uh, she’ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.Yeah.Hey.Uh, we’re on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.I can’t talk about it or I’ll get removed from the jury.I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we’re just talking.Oh, Jim. Hey.There’s this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse…Who looks exactly like you.Yeah. No, it’s uncanny.What?No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.No, they bring it in.",
    "Ryan": "He’s rubbing his neck. He’s rubbing his neck!He’s rubbing his neck.There’s no connection between the origin story and the quest.We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it’s the bear’s quest.Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It’s also a little derivative of a serias called ‘Bear Man’. Did you look that up?Okay.[holding a knitted iPad case] It’s amazing. It’s so great. Thank you.Hey, who’s in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?An ‘F’ train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.Okay, well, I’ll just stick with my mojito.",

    "Holly": "Hi.Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn’t Michael Scott. You old bastard.Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.[as Curly] I most certainly am.Unnnnnnngh![as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh][in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!Hi.Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.Would you put those out?Oh, it’s so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It’s like a party for limousine drivers.Oh, it’s fabulous. I love what you did.[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they’re both loaded. [makes gun noises]It’s a pea shoot…Yeah, kind of.Oh…AJ gave me that.Mmhmm.Why?That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn’t seen any of the Toy Story movies.No. I know. I was like, “What? Are you serious?”Get a life!We sat down and we watched them all in one day.Now he’s the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.Next day I found him in my bed.We live together.He had a little note pinned to him that said, “You’ve got a friend in me.”Yeah. I love him.Oh, God, no.Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.Okay, listen, I’m gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose by the end of this year, we’re over.Yeah.You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.Dwight’s right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I’m really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It’s obvious to me I’m not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I’m leaving.You think this is funny?Michael, you have to let this go. I’m with someone else. I don’t feel that way anymore.You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I’d get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?Michael, I’m sorry.You guys, it wasn’t my fault.What? AJ!What are you doing here? Oh, my God.Wow! Nice.Oh… when did you get here?Oh, I think everyone’s on edge because of the strangler trial.Hey, I’m so glad you came down. It’s been so much harder than I expected.Oh, okay, get ready for this. You’re not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.It was blue cheese dressing.",
