    "Andy": "What about this one? It’s kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley’s monitor]Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this… this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don’t get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in][removes teeth] Creed’s going?!Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.Hey, Danny.I’m really sorry, but we can’t come to your party tonight.You were?We’re just like, totally caught in the middle here.Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go…Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.What’s up, man?When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard’s Regards.I started to ask myself, “Do I have big plans here?” I didn’t want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that’s actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we’re going to Danny’s bar. Public School.",
    "Jim": "I don’t know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That’s… not… yours.Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn’t seem to realize that it wasn’t his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won’t notice?Stop.Sounds like someone’s really trying to convince us that he’s not the Scranton Strangler.[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!I’ve never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] …no.So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.That’s right.Yikes.Oh, no.No. No, I’m not gonna-no.I don’t care.Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.It’s not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don’t know about?Oooh! You can’t handle the truth! [laughs]We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?Hey.When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don’t work hard. Oh, here’s something. Uh, why didn’t you ever call Pam back?Yeah. I mean, I’m not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I’m just saying… but you know, to not even call her back is…Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.Nope.Just tell her the real reason.Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.Hey, man.To be honest, I still can’t believe he didn’t call her back. Who doesn’t call a dork like that back?[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]",
    "Stanley": "What’s a seven letter word for purse?Nope. Starts with an H.Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o’clock, I will see you all tomorrow:Night, everybody.How many freakin’ vampires am I supposed to care about these days?[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]",
    "Kevin": "[sitting at Phyllis’ desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.You own a bar?I don’t think that she would leave Jim for Danny.I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I’m like an elephant in that way.Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl… Creed’s a maybe.Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like… next Halloween.They’re really upset about the whole Danny situation.Yeah, but wait, don’t tell them that we said anything to you.Or you’re dead.Okay.I am so sorry.I just thought-Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn’t tell you first.[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.[bleep] you, Gabe!Pam. Can you vote for other people?",
    "Michael": "[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam’s got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a… costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board… OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!MACGRUBER!Oh, here we go![laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?Blackula!Oh, so… I almost forgot. You’ll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That’s like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.Yeah. I’m sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.Really? We’re good?Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl’s hand] Okay.Oh. It’s a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I’d like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they’re missing.Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!Yeah, I bet it is! If you’re gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin’s. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don’t care if I take a bullet. We’re gonna call them, we’re gonna put them on speakerphone right now…And we are going to straighten this out.Mmhm!I’m a little peeved at Darryl right now.No, he didn’t go behind my back. He went over my head.What is taking someone from behind?It was a good idea, though.[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don’t-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That’s inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?Oh, you’re sorry?What did you just thought?All right.Okay.Well, don’t let it happen again.I-Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That’s not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.Okay, that might help. If you said “I’m sorry” in front of everybody.In front of me.So that’s it.Is it?Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it’s cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I’m cool! I’m hip and I’m jive! And I don’t care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!Still don’t know who I am? I’ll give you a hint. I go over other people’s heads.What’s a bad idea?NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I’m not Darryl. And thank God I’m not Darryl.Hey, can I play? Why don’t you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?Thank you.If they’re good ideas, I’m not gonna say no!That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?Oh…Well…Stop it! Stop, stop. We’re thinking. We’re thinking about it.You don’t have to point to the fact that we’re thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.I am not budging on the hat issue.Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we’ll give her a call.Sorry I was a jerk.Friends fight. Friends fight.",
    "All": "Yay! [applause]",
    "Pam": "[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you’ve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!What?I’m supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I’m standing next to Popeye, but… Jim doesn’t want to put his costume on.We were basically Romeo and Juliet.Except where Juliet doesn’t have that great a time and Romeo doesn’t call back after two dates.But I’ve learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim’s shoulder] He’s a cartoon sailor.And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before… or sit on it.Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It’s not even a history.It was two.No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don’t know, you never called me back, so…Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that’s what happened.Hmm-mm.Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can’t vote for yourself.Michael, this is a bad idea.Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?Angela as the nurse!I’d remember talking about Jim. That wasn’t it.I did. And it’s just one of those things that’s going to keep gnawing at me, like “gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn’t he? I have no idea why.”Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.Oh, wow!Aww, my hero!Okay, everyone, I’ve tallied the votes, and the winner… of the costume celebration spectacular… and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book… Oscar Martinez.",
    "Dwight": "[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley![has his hands around Jim’s neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you’d be so strangled right now. If you’re out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.To my chickens I’m the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That’s very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute’s mom.You’re only one third as beautiful and only half her height.Lake Erie.Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?He went to Gabe behind your back.He went over your head to go behind your back.No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can’t have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.Yeah. Here’s another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl’s idea.Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don’t need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can’t believe this doesn’t make you mad!Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.Let’s just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.",
    "Oscar": "So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn’t actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You’d have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don’t actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I’m not the only one who sees this, right?That’s a great name. You’re hilarious. A plus!Guys? You’re arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth… forty bucks.I guess you could say I’m still in costume. I’m a rational consumer.Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I’m a rational consumer.I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!",
    "Erin": "Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?Oh! [fumbles for phone]Kelly! Great costume!He says no.[hands are being forced to the letters] A… S… S… H… E… T?Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That’s enough.Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.",
    "Gabe": "[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can’t read m-m-my Poker Face… [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they’re going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.That is correct.Not here.Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so… no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let’s give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]Okay…In the future, you need to get Michael’s approval on anything before coming to me.Okay, well, obviously if it’s a really, really good idea, my door is open.Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?Yeah.You’re right, we don’t need a hat.Okay. We’re going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.Okay, why don’t we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.",
    "Todd Packer": "Lame. Why don’t witches wear panties?Because they need to grip the broom!Has anyone started calling you “Gabe-wad” yet?I don’t think you get it.Halpert, you lookin’ for someone to bang your wife?",
    "Danny": "Gabe-wad.Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I’m having at my bar.Public School, at exit 11.So. You’re all on the list!Okay.Hey.I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.For sure.What are you talking about?Jim and Pam really don’t want you to go?I’ll talk to them.Okay.Okay.Can you imagine? It’s just crazy.Look, I’m just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.Exactly.No! Two or three dates.Was it two? I thought it was three.[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren’t weird.I don’t think it’s gonna work out the way you think.Hey.This is some party, huh?Are you serious?You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and…Okay. You wanna know?  I didn’t call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.Do you honestly want to know why I didn’t call her back on a date over four years ago?Okay. Honestly. I didn’t call you back because I-thought you seemed a little… dorky.",
    "Darryl": "Dracula.Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.I’m just glad we’re gonna try it out.Yeah. We’re cool.What’s under your shirt?[answers phone] Hello?I’m good.This is embarrassing, Michael.Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]I’m not mad. Are you mad?Well, I’m sorry if it seems that way to you.Mike.You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I’m not apologizing.That’s it.Yes.No.You’re gonna be missing out on some good ideas.You said no to this one!What have you done for me?What have you done for me?Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you’ve ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.I don’t understand the point of a hat.Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?This was your freshman year.No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.",
    "Toby": "[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It’s a great stick, right?Thanks!No.Oh.",
    "Ryan": "It’s really good. It’s a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.No.Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It’s all guys.Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That’s a good line.Fifty seven. Fifty eight.Shake things up. I’m a Nader guy.",
    "Kelly": "I get that. I get that.Um, if I’m out, I’m going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?If I have to vote for someone, I don’t want it to be someone who can beat me.",
    "Creed": "Hey, what’s the crowd like, Danny? Our age?Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.Best Edward James Olmos costume I’ve ever seen. Like, freaky good.",
    "Phyllis": "I don’t know, they’re both handsome.I think he-Oh.What should we ask?An asset!",
    "Angela": "So, what happened?KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she’s out.Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don’t even want to give Pam a compliment, because she’s so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.I don’t like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let’s not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.",
    "Meredith": "Wait, wait. She hasn’t moved in awhile."
