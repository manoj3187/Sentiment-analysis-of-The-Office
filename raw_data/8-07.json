    "Andy": "Erin.In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I’m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.Nobody. Just say that I’m-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I’m going to refuse to take it.Just make up a phone call. It’s not a real call. Make it up.And come and tell me. Doesn’t matter what it is.I’m not going to take it. And then he’s going to be like “whoa this is a really important meeting”.Okay.Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I’ll tell you how we can beat it.Yeah.I’m sorry – I’m with a very important client. It’ll have to wait.There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.I don’t think she’s dead.She’s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.Yeah. Um line 1?Hi.Ooh, gosh!Officer.Did she have any last words or?Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.That is so mom.Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?I’m delivering it from the fridge. It’s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?Yeah and we’re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you’d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs][scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?Well we’re all musicians and we play together sometimes.Thank you.Miss no more! What do you play? Join us![to Kevin] CEOs don’t play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.Great!I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you’re in a rock and roll band with somebody, you’re bonded for life!Yeah, even cooler.Yeah, absolutely!Midnight what?Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?Well, we are playing. We’re all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It’s a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]Maybe we could switch instruments.‘Cause, uh, my body’s starting to get bruised.We had to leave because of creative differences.Well-[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.No deleted scenes 🙁",
    "Erin": "Yeah.Who’s calling?You’re not going to take it?Ohohohoh.You’re not going to get it though?Copy that.Andy.You have a very important call.Are you sure? It’s really, really important.Really? Because your mother is dead.She’s dead. She was hit by a bus.This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.Line 2.",
    "Client": "Uh well we’ve been going with…Oh my God.Oh you must take this call. It’s…",
    "Dwight": "Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.Oh we know.Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you’re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That’s right. You’re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.That’s just absurd.Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.Why would I or anyone else think that you’re hot right now? I can’t impregnate you, and that’s the driving force between male-female attraction.Meh… you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you’re at an all-time low.You think Jim’s lying? [laughs] That’s so cute. I know he’s lying.Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.If we’re going to work together, we need some ground rules.Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.Rule two: we stop at nothing.Rule three: Don’t fall in love.We’re gonna bust this guy.So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.None taken. What do you got?I don’t see what’s so ugly about him. He’s got the broad face of a brewer.Hmm?Just ugly enough to have deniability.Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can’t lie with his body.The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.With the crotch.Psst. We’re not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]Exactly.Okay, just shut it.I can’t tell. It’s unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.Time for me to find out.Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I’m slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim’s crotch]I’m fine, I’m totally fine.Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight’s hands away] Wha- Jim.Aw, cramp, I’m just- [grabs Jim’s crotch again]I’m sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.She called it crazy? Aw, man, that’s insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.And she called it nuts?Come on.[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.Why don’t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I’m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.[mimicking] Well, that’s what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.Jim, are you serious?[to old man] Okay, you’re done.Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?Yep, he’s lying.I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he’s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?Look at the numbers. Every single time, it’s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.It’s important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-It’s not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.Doesn’t it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?But… hey, Cece’s toothbrush.",
    "Darryl": "[on phone]It’s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.Dude.Look man this is a bad idea.Really? That is messed up man.You’re a bad man Andy Bernard.That stuff can come back to get you. It’s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle…What are you doing with my lunch?It’s not pizza.I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?Nice scatting, man.That was never agreed upon.Again, never agreed upon.Usually that life is short and tragic. That’s okay, right?Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.Hey, why don’t you and me play those?Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?What, you don’t like the blues?Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn’t really fit in with our thing.No man, we are.No, no, no.Every day.",
    "Pam": "Hey Cathy.How’s it going? Everything make sense?Great.Oh no, I’m fine.Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.I’m training a temp to be my replacement while I’m on maternity leave. Oh I should’ve mentioned I’m pregnant. You probably didn’t notice because it’s impossible to tell I’m so small. But yeah I’m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!You doubt it?Why do you doubt that she’s single?It’s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam’s desk huh?I’m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She’s obviously super cute I get it. But I’d like to point out there’s 50 pounds more of me to love if that’s your thing.Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.Really well thank you all.Hey.Helen Mirren. Hot?Huh. What about Cathy?Yeah. Do you think she’s hot?I’m not asking if you’re in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?You don’t find Cathy attractive?Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.Yes, because she’s hot, right?The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you’re a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren’t true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who’s telling me the truth.Dwight, am I hot right now?What about before? Was I attractive before?Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.Yep, that’s the Dwight I need.Okay.I think so. Okay.Well, what does that… is that… okay.Yep, good.Honesty is very important to me.Let’s just see how we feel when we get there.Hmm.Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?Mike Tibbets, really?Kelly, calm down.I don’t think Jim cares about his hair.Jim’s on to me.Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.Yep.No, Kelly, don’t.Is he puffing out his chest?No. Maybe he just said something funny.I think he’s just making her laugh.Why’s he making her laugh so much?Why was he making her laugh so much?Oh, hey, I’ll just be a second.Okay.Oscar, Cathy has a question![to Jim] Yeah?Why won’t you just admit that she’s attractive? It’s kind of annoying that you won’t say it.Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that’s where we are now.Yeah, its nuts. But I don’t know what else to do.This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.Wait, that’s it? That’s the question you’re going to ask him?Ah, see, was that so hard?Really?Wait, what?Jim, you have high blood pressure.Doesn’t your dad have high blood pressure?When was the last time you went to the doctor?Dwight, stop. I’m not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?Come on, let’s go. I wanna call your doctor.Just go home. It doesn’t matter.",
    "Cathy": "Hi.I think everything is under control.You should sit down.No I should go fill out my paperwork.Are you okay?Yeah, take your time.[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-Sorry, um, I’ll just go ask Oscar.",
    "Ryan": "Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?Yeah me too.So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?Hey, who’s this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?Yeah, ’cause his mom’s car’s probably not a Nissan Z.",
    "Jim": "Hmm. Doubt it.What’s that?Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we’d save her from Ryan right?Hey.Yeah. Super pretty.The temp?Nope.And I’m telling you, I don’t.No, I don’t.No, I’m not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I’m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It’s true, but it doesn’t help anybody.Okay. Uh, I don’t. So are we good? [Jim leaves]Oh, I stand corrected.Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.Mm-hmm.Not his mom’s car.Touche?Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I’m in the clear. If that wasn’t for the matchmaker test, then… Cathy, he’s a really nice guy.Dwight!Dwight! Dwight![to Cathy] Sorry about that.Dwight! [pushes Dwight’s hands away] Why?Leave.Mm-hmm?[laughs] Told you.You okay?Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?Stop shoving me.[to Pam] Really?Si.Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.No, I’m not worried. Because this lie isn’t for me, it’s for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back… yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven’t had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.No.I am not lying.Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?Yeah, but I don’t smoke.I don’t know.Okay, easy. Trust me, I’m around for the long-haul.Okay.Thank you.",
    "Gabe": "Well he’s probably a drug dealer. That’s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.It’s one of the most common fetishes.",
    "Toby": "It’s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.Radiant.You know it’s not just pregnant women who don’t get their due. You know who’s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It’s a pregnant Helen Mirren.[everyone agrees]",
    "Oscar": "Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.No, no. Not even.Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.In this case yes.",
    "Offscreen": "Good energy",
    "Phyllis": "Yeah you have this sexy glow.No we’re not.",
    "Val": "Not bad fellas, you’re better than you look.I caught it.I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.I think the music left without you.",
    "Kevin": "Hey, screw you!We’re called Kevin and the Zits.I have a tambourine.Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!We all got to go sometime.[to drummer] Dude, you’re on TV! You’re the sportscaster on channel seven.You do that on TV!Guys, I’ve got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and güiro]Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.Maybe we should warm up with some scales?[music plays] Whoo!Mm-hmm.Are you serious? From Star Trek?Yeah.Guys, this means they’re Kevin and the Zits now.",
    "Robert": "Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?You’re a band.I miss being in a band.Tambourine? You know I’m the CEO, right?I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.[to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.You guys mind if they join us?What should we play?Midnight Rambler?",
    "Kelly": "Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don’t want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy’s hot.[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!I mean, I guess he’d be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he’ll get hair plugs.Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It’s called being a nice person.I’m gonna write something mean on his wall.",
    "Curtis": "You guys sound great, man.Yeah.[singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!",
    "Drummer": "Go Eagles! [laughs]",
    "Pam and Kelly": "With the crotch?",
    "Creed": "Who said that?How’d I get this long triangle?",
    "Old Man": "Uh, are you all in line?You have to share the machine with others.Thank you.I have a new heart, you know.",
    "Andy and Darryl": "Oh baby I love your way.Wanna be with you night and day.Oh baby I love your way.",
    "Darryl and Kevin": "And day."
