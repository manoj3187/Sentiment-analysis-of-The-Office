    "Dwight": "Go. Get the door.Go. Push!Push!Really shove it.Shove it through! Break it!I got a splinter.I’ve got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]You guys should use a hand truck.No.Michael, I would like to be the elf.[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.Gather round. Secret Santa, let’s go. Let’s go. Come on. Stanley, no, I’m going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.I want to do it.Hey, I could get some flares from my car.First present, Oscar.Okay. Okay. That’s enough. Let’s keep it moving on. Jim.Pam.All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]Michael.We don’t do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.Angela, you’re up.Okay, moving along. Meredith, let’s go.It’s already been stolen this round. Pick something else.You and me, Michael. Yes!I never said it was better than an iPod.Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets … Christmas.No trades.“A real man makes his own luck.” Billy Zane.No. I want it. I’m going to use it.True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .... and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]This is so awesome.Thank you.Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?You shouldn’t do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.Yes.",
    "Michael": "Here we are.Oh god.No, no, turn it around.You’ll break it.You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don’t break the branches, Dwight.All right.Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.Merry Christmas!Did it work?A, that’s what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That’s what Christmas is all about.[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I’m kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G’s. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I’ll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.No! No way! It… no.You wanna be Santa?Have you ever seen Santa?Okay.Well, I’m sorry. It just doesn’t work.That makes sense because he has elfish features.You get something good this year?Yeah? Who did you have?I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.All right, let’s count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?Not great.No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let’s do Secret Santa.Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It’s like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, “Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.”No, don’t!Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.You don’t know that.I did?What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn’t matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out]So Phyllis is basically saying, “Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt’s worth.” I gave Ryan an iPod.I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person’s gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else’s gift or choose a new gift.Well, I call it fun!Because it’s better. Because it’s more special.Shut it. No, it’s not. Okay, just give it a shot.Okay, Meredith is up first. Here’s the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else’s gift that they’ve already gotten, like the oven mitt.Yankee Swap! That’s what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.I think this is going great.Everyone wants the iPod. It’s a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It’s beautiful.Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don’t know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.[opens present] “In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.”Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?Last gift. Kevin.[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it’s a success and I’m the one who ended up with Dwight’s stupid paintball pellets.Well, I didn’t. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!It wasn’t. It wasn’t that much. It was $3,000.Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party’s so lame.All right, now, you’re the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?Cool, cool. Box it up.Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it’s a party. Come on. If I can’t throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?Go, here we go!Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how’s it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]No, no, no, no. We’ll find some, don’t leave the party.Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.Not bad. And if it couldn’t go to Ryan, you are the guy I’d want it to go to.You’re welcome.No way. Oh, you’re kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.Oh, let’s fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby’s gonna fix you up.Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.Hey, Merry Christmas.[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It’s happening!Yeah, that sounds good.Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What’s better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It’s really the greatest day of all time.Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard’s?Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let’s head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?Okay!",
    "Kevin": "[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?Do we have one?I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn’t [smiles happily].Should we just keep opening up the presents?I want the foot bath.That’s the thing I bought myself. I’m really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.Kevin Malone.[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.Mine.Thanks for the party, Michael.",
    "Jim": "So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I’m also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won’t. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.I think I did a pretty good job.Well, I can’t tell you cause it’s a secret.Yeah?Well, there’s a $20 limit, right? So .. ?That’s great. Well don’t tell me who it is, cause I can ..Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]Great. Where did you get it?He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.There’s a little more to it.What is Yankee Swap?I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.Oh, shouldn’t we … I bought that specifically for Pam.Sure you don’t want the teapot?Right.No. No. Definitely. It’s ..Got to be kidding me.Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?Come on, it’s a shamrock keychain. Good luck.Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?You don’t even drink tea.To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it’s a little too much to handle.You know, you don’t have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.But ..Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.I didn’t think you were going to get that one. I really didn’t.",
    "Angela": "Is there anything we’re missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?We’ll see.Fifty.[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?It sounds mean.Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He’s not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]I’ll take the poster. Some people like these.What is that?There should be some ..",
    "Phyllis": "Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?I’m sorry, everybody.I knitted it for you.Hi guys.Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?",
    "Ryan": "Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.Wasn’t there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.Yeah, you left the price tag on.Yeah.And I have to give it to her? I don’t have a choice?Yeah, I figured.Hey.Ryan Howard.What line of work you in, Bob?We’re running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?Oh, no.I really did not do anything.[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?Oh, how did I not guess that?",
    "Pam": "You do realize that we can’t serve liquor at the party.I think the tree looks nice.[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It’s awesome.Yeah, we call it White Elephant.I’ll take the iPod.I want the iPod.Well, I mean, it’s an iPod. But ..Sorry, I ..Maybe because you hated her present so much.How much?I know. It’s totally going to change the way I work out.So what are you going to get me instead?[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!Yeah, I think I made the right choice.Oh, my God! It’s incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",
    "Kevin & Oscar": "One, two, three. [they lift and start to move a desk]",
    "Darryl": "Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.Yeah.Yeah, I’ve seen Santa.Who cares?Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I’m done.I had to. I needed defense.It’s defense.It is worth it.Are you kidding? You wait.That’s okay, Mike.All right. Thanks, man.",
    "Toby": "I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.Well, it’s for Angela, so ..We’re really not supposed to serve alcohol.",
    "Oscar": "I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don’t know anything about Creed. I know his name’s Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he’s Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..Why are we doing this?I’ll take the … teapot.You got a bonus check?I’m in.Michael? Poor Richard’s?",
    "Stanley": "I know how to plug something in.[after Ryan opens a new gift – a nameplate saying ‘Kelly’] That was meant for Kelly.And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.All right, I’m done now.Stanley Hudson.",
    "All": "Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]",
    "Kelly": "Oh, good, that was from me.[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.That’s like, the creepiest thing that I’ve ever seen.I will steal the iPod.Damn it.Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.Hey.I don’t know.",
    "Creed": "That’s from me.I don’t know. It was so long ago.Yep. That’s exactly what happened.[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.",
    "Meredith": "I’ll take the teapot.Damn it.I really want the iPod.I’ll take the oven mitt.We can drink?Me. Please.The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year’s resolution that I’m not going to drink anymore. During the week.Yeah.Yep.Yeah.",
    "Liquor Store Clerk": "It comes to $166.41.Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.",
    "JIm": "Okay ..",
    "Roy": "This is awesome.Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don’t have to. I’m gonna save a ton of money.I don’t know. Probably like, a sweater or something.I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.It’s possible. I can’t believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.Come on! Shaun Alexander? He’s the best back in the league.Oh, no. That is not worth it.Never.",
    "Bob Vance": "Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.Oh, hey. Listen up. We’re going to Poor Richard’s. Who’s in?",
    "Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Kevin": "One, two, three. [do a shot]",
    "Todd Packer": "[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe![rapping] What’s up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]Pacman need a drinky."
