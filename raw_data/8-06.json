    "Andy": "[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it’s closing time. You don’t got to go home but you can’t stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]Closing time.Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It’s weird.Closing timeOne last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.Come on pam!I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hoooâ€¦hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don’t want to singâ€¦ no traditions!Whose your favorite iron chef?You go first.Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimesâ€¦Umpfâ€¦that’s not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.They’re both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can pictureâ€¦I would agree with that.End the mistakes, easy-I would like that.What do you got?Sounds controversial.Do not go there! You’re the deuce I never want to drop.Go do the voodoo that you do so well.Mmhmmm.Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.And I’d like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to callâ€¦Dwightâ€¦If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.Dwight’s our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so Iâ€¦Alright everybody, you are doing great!Gahhh. That’s five strikes.Dwight we got five strikes.Did the email go out orâ€¦Well, th- There’s gotta be a way to stop it.Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.What?!Nn no.No!Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.Kevin has that lovability.Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-Well now hold on it, it-[to Dwight] Where you going?Dwight, there’s just a small matter of a-What are you doing? It’s 5 to 5.That’s insane!Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.Enngh-Oh!Let’s not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin]Yeah?I don’t think so.Yeah. I’m still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let’s hold off on the D-man for now.",
    "Erin": "[Laughs and shrieks]Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.You’re a real crumb bum, you know that?Dwight’s car is gone.Uh, he’s at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.Do you need a hand?[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.Haho!",
    "Jim": "[On phone] …W R K.Uh no it’s W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that’s what you are hearing.I’m just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby’s in a really good place now. Soâ€¦my pitch isâ€¦me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.Is that off again?Ok.Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.Dwight, question.If this doomsday device goes off…If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?Ok.Nope.Hmmâ€¦Heda. [alert] No.Ok, where is he?I’ll try both.Robert.Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.You up for a game?Exactly. Here we go. Let’s do it.Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.In the box. [hits it straight into the floor][a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?Nah, I think it’s mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.Oh, oh yeah.Yes. Right now? Yes.Here you go. [throws it over glass]Awww, sorry. Did it break?You sure?What kinda iPhone is that?Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?Ha ha. No, I don’t. No, I don’t. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone][hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]I’m alright.Yep.Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow]Yeah. That does not feel good.Ok, he didn’t fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.I wasn’t here that day.No- Ok. Well, we’ll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?Ok, this is crazy.I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80’s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don’t do that, I think I’ll be alright.[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?No? Come on.Well, that is… because you didn’t realize that… I was left-handed.",
    "Andy/Pam": "[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.",
    "Pam": "Let’s see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I’ve heard ‘Closing Time’ a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don’t know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.I bet he went home.What are you doing?Uhm.Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody’s nerfect, right?No. It’s a jokey saying. Pobody’s nerfect, like I can’t even say those words right. Ha.You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.I’m thinking cow-Just don’t talk about the email, okay? He’s gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.Just trust me.I got this.Hahhh, thanks for everything.[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!This could be real. Dwight’s pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.You couldn’t fix it.Yes you were.I don’t think so, babe.",
    "Stanley": "[singing] Closing time every new beginningâ€¦I’ve never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it’s time to go home. Nowâ€¦it’s my favorite song.Goodnight.This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.Try mose1234.[pulls out Brandy bottle] Wellâ€¦I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones’ signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year’s Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.",
    "Andy/Stanley": "[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.",
    "Robert": "[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.[to dwight] Did you need something from us?Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.Who are they?Andrew sometimes I feel like you don’t know me at all.Simplyâ€¦end the mistakesWhen I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn’t that be nice?End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can’t have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don’t know food at all.I’ll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash]Jim what are youâ€¦What a surprise.Yeah.A game or a match?In the box.Sounded like mine.Well, it’s mine. You took it out of my bag.Can I have it?Yep.Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor][censored beep] ha, Jesus.Nah, it’s good.Yeah.It’s the standard one. The one everyone has.It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?My serve!Take it easy. Nice and easy.Oo!You alright?Skinned knee.Oo, a little ice on that maybe.Okay. My serve.Eleven love. I win again.I don’t think so.Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don’t even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.Let’s wait, until we have something to smoke about.",
    "Dwight": "[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.Whaâ€¦Yes. Your attention. Uh becauseâ€¦ No that is all. [walks out]Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted “We’re number two!’. As with all my dreams, I’m guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I’ve been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.[opens folder] Allow me. You’re going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ughâ€¦should’ve used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else’s work.Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?Well, I can make this work. I’ll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.I will do my voodoo.The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you’re out.Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you’ve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.Robert’s favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn’t strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.P.S. We should should kill him.No, it’s an accountability booster.Jim, you’re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smileâ€¦nod. Smile and nod.They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Likeâ€¦not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctorâ€¦But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.[alert goes off] Oh, there’s one mistake.It’s not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.Well, I wouldn’t say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she’s hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]No questions.Accountability booster.I haven’t even considered it. That’s how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.How about Scrantonstrangler666.No. Oh shoot. Ha ha haâ€¦You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won’t even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.Really?It goes out automatically at five P.M.Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.No.You don’t deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.No you didn’t, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!Hey, you can’t just change the rules because you don’t like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.What?Good luck finding a new job idiots. I’ll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?Get lost.What does it look like I’m doing? Digging a grave for a horse.If you hit another horse, you’ve dug to far.In. I’m hungry.Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It’s “Nobody’s perfect.” Nice stroke, Pam.I hadn’t heard that before, that’s, that’s funny.Any specific animal?Don’t say cow- Ugh.Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]They’re not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn’t even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you’ve ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I’m gonna have to work with them forever, aren’t I?Hey, Andy.Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate…Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all…",
    "Darryl": "Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.Oh yeah.Ahhâ€¦We don’t really do those. We just sign the thing.I’ll be there.It’s not a race.Who knows what the belt is for?Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn’t get much use nowadays.You done?Once you read the packet, sign the back.Actually, Val, why don’t you come with? I’ll need the extra hands to carry them back.Mmhmm.

    "Val": "Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.Are you really this lazy?Hey.Yeahaâ€¦yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.Yeah, sure.That’s too much Doodle and not enough Lab.That’s what I’m sayin’.Thanks for the coffee.Are you asking me on a date?Because I don’t date coworkers. It’s not personal, it’s a matter of policy.Don’t quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]",
    "Gabe": "Hey.Monday’s suck.Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.Yes. For Gabe.Whom I’m seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.I’m not technically seeing her, but uh I’ve seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]Ok, but once this starts, it’s going to be moving fast. It’s going to be hot and heavy and I don’t want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondaysâ€¦Toby I’m going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she’s going to be screaming it tonight.Hey! Watch it.It’s for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I’m Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don’t be nervous.Look at this, this is enormous.I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that’s the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow]It’s like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It’s a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don’t bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Valâ€¦Uh.Decaf frap-[to Val] Hey. You’re welcome.So, tonight I was thinking, I’m gonna go to the cemetery. I’m gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you’d like to come with me.Yes, I am.I could quit. Problem solved.Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I’m just chillin’ at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.You know, there’s this expression: Bro’s before Ho’s. And what that’s short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don’t buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.",
    "Toby": "For you?Who are you seeing? That’s grâ€¦Oh.You know I don’t have to do the paperwork unless you’re actually dating.But I meanâ€¦uh have you talked to her? Is shâ€¦Do you know her last name, yet?She’s going to be screaming her own last name?Good luck Gabe.",

    "Kelly": "What emails are you talking about?That’s not that bad actually.Um, no we’re not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.Whaâ€¦what’s Dwight’s mothers name.Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!",
