    "Andy": "[exiting office] Everyone stop what you’re doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.He’s gone, damn it! He’s been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he’s staying in Florida forever.Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody’s gonna open it. You’d have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed][to Creed standing in front of the “treasure box”] Now, carefully… open the box.Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don’t care what it is, dealer’s choice.Damn it.Hello?Oh, now mine’s broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.No.I don’t buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I’m gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally ‘puerto ricania’ when i see you.What?Yeah, that’s awesome. That’s great.I’m just dealing with Erin’s stuff since apparently she’s not coming back. And she didn’t bother to tell anyone.Ryan, why didn’t you tell me?You never update it.Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?I’m going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It’s crazy, right? It’s just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] ‘You’re about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?’ Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!",
    "Everyone": "[gasps] What?! Why is that?",
    "Angela": "So, he’s alive.Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.Ugh.",
    "Phyllis": "If Dwight’s not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?[laughs] Yeah.Oh. [looks away]Make them kiss each other.[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin’s desk] What are you doing?[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.",
    "Oscar": "You guys, we’ve gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the “treasure box” and slams it down on Dwight’s desk]When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office “Don’t touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?”] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There’s nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I’m Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.I am dying to know what’s in there.We knew. Ryan told us.",
    "Creed": "Hi, hello.[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It’s a photo of all of us.",
    "Pam": "Aw, that’s so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling][on phone with Jim] He said, ‘I did like Dwight’? He’s gonna fire him.Robert doesn’t talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.Did you actually try your hardest?If Dwight’s about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That’s all you can do.Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.We’ll find another receptionist. I mean, that’s easy. We’ll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly][to Jim] Hey, stranger!Aw, I missed you.Aw.",
    "Dwight": "[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don’t know that it’s poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I’m glad he’s OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man’s treasure and all. Wow![on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it’s been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]Ah![to Robert] You think you’re excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh][sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that’s so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!Don’t even care!Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven’t always got along and at times, I’ve even hated your guts. But…[smiles] bye, bye. I win.[drops golf ball into Jim’s open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen’s bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart][from distanced golf cart] Robert! I’m gonna win, ha ha, I’m the gentleman! Suck it![at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.[to Nellie] I told you.You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It’s gonna make some really good toilet paper.What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?What, your stylist ran out of ‘messy spray’? [others laugh]You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop ’til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh][to Packer] Silence.[interrupts] I know what you’re trying to do, I don’t want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.Different guy.[interrupts] That you look like the world’s tallest hobbit. [others laugh][straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You’re like an Amish return stick.Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.Uh-huh.Wait. [holds up fingers] He’s gonna kill the store? And he’s gonna fire me?[smiles] That’s two things.Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they’re not going to work today.You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It’s gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she’s a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight][Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.[attempting to break from Jim’s grasp] Ah![clutching side] Oh, god! You… oh! My appendix-My wound hasn’t healed yet.Oh, man![stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah![trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim’s legs]I was trying to go-Ok, ok.Then you know what? I’m just gonna have to run right through you.[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]This. Ends. Now.[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]Anything else you need to talk about?[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it’s show time.",
    "Nellie": "Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.Trick… there’s no such thing. It’s not even a real English duo.I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn’t exist either.He doesn’t even care.[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We’ll just chalk it up to cultural bias.Oh.Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.How did that look?[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let’s begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes… but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.",
    "Robert California": "I am loving the chemistry between you two.I bet. I’m excited.If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter… yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.That’s right. Your little finger.I’ll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.I’m gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.But, there’s a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They’re cheap. They’re unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone’s wives do us.I couldn’t just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.[to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [Dwight enters] which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.I don’t see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.That was never on the table.And yet Todd, it’s you who’s fired.",
    "Jim": "Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]This is the last time I’ll ever see Dwight. It’s a weird feeling, it’s, um, what’s the word? It’s not, it’s not bittersweet. It’s uh… sweet. Yeah.[to Dwight] All right. So… I guess this is it.[attempts to shake Dwight’s hand] Goodbye, Dwight.Well, he’s Florida’s problem now.What’s that?I thought you liked the store?Thank you.Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.[enters room] All right. There he is.Can I just talk to you for one quick second?Um, actually it’s, it’s for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]You know, I just think you should know that-Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it’s on the record. I have a plane to catch.No, no, I think it was more like, ‘you know, I liked him, but I don’t anymore because he did a bad job, so I’m definitely gonna yell at him’.I tried. He will not listen.Yes… my pretty hardest. Look, you haven’t dealt with him in awhile, all right. He’s like super Dwight. It’s like he’s been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.Stanley’s very upset that we’re leaving Florida. But he would back me up.OK. All right.[enters abruptly] Dwight.OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.Dwight, he’s gonna kill the store.And then, I’m pretty sure he’s gonna fire you for it.Yes.Dwight, please.OK, first of all, they’ve mostly worked, so-Dwight, come o-Gross! Don’t lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?Gross!What? What, what, what, what, what?I’m sorry.I’m so sorry, I forgot.You all right? You ok?What are you doing?Get up.Get up. All right? I’m not gonna let you by.OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn’t work.[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.This is dangerous.Why?Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?Hey.I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]",
    "Darryl": "[entering Andy’s office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?I’ll put you down for shortbreads.No. No.I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.You know what? It’s your first time, let’s split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don’t know I’ll just take, uh, accounting.OK, great.[exits Andy’s office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It’s not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.You’re new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.That doesn’t mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.[to Kevin] What’s a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can’t trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.Thank you.Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?Baby, if youâ€™re watching this, you’re not chubby, you’re beautiful. Daddy’s just got to sell some cookies. And we’re also gonna exercise more. It’s gonna be fun.No, no, no, no. It’s not worth it.Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?You’re not talking… triple digits?[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.[in a feminine voice] Kevin can’t come to the phone right now because he’s busy with us.I don’t know, man, they might think we’re drag queens.Forget it, man.I’m out. And so is Toby.This may be wrong. But there’s a limit to what I would do for my child.[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They’re back. [Everyone greets them]",
    "Toby": "[entering Andy’s office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha’s first year in the troops, so I’m selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?What?You can’t claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can’t you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?That’s it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.No, no, no. It’s not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?See?No, you hit the road, jack.You know, why don’t we split the order? It’s only fair.I’m, I’m not gonna comment on my personal life.No.50?[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.Yeah, I don’t know why you picked names that are also guys’ names.Don’t make me be your pony, Kevin.Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man’s horsey.",
    "Erin": "[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I’m home, babaloo.[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don’t know how she survived without me.Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I’m staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.Can you help me? I’m trying to make a video chat with Andy.Can you just do it?‘Erin123’[annoyed] All right.That’s so weird. There’s something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.Yes, this is too tan. This right here-This is a tanned spot.Well, Andy, I’m not coming back.I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]Andy?",
    "Elderly Woman": "[rises from chair] Oh, here let me help.",
    "Irene": "When can I introduce you to my grandson? He’s a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.[takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?Just open the program and type in his user name.[after briefly typing] Here, type in your password.That’s a terrible password. And you don’t ‘make a video chat’, you video chat.[waves] Hello!",
    "Kevin": "Cookies, eh?[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it’s the best. And fall time thinks that it’s the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine’s thinks that it’s the best. But gather round, peeps, I’ll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that’s the truth.I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.I do.Oh, I definitely do.[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don’t fight over me.No. Wait, no. I’m buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and… 69ed.Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts… no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]That’s true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby’s probably in bed with some model.[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. ‘Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I’ve reached my decision. I have decided… that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.No, it’s not worth it? That’s too bad. ‘Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.Hungrier.Hungrier.Oh yeah, I’m talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again][holding mobile phone up] Go.Perfect! Now people will think I’m doing hot girls all day.Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?What do you mean?No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I’ll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I’m even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is… hmph… that’s ah… so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]",
    "Gabe": "I’m not just saying this, that was the best thing I’ve ever seen.",
    "Todd Packer": "When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how ’bout I pop up also? I guess we’d have to say ‘power of three’. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You’d spin off right. I’d spin off-Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?Aw, I’m just trying to-That’s… that’s the same guy. It’s the joke I made.Well, looks like Shnoot’s a no-show. Guess he wasn’t vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I’m your man.Sup?If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She’s the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!What, you, I, I can’t get fired. I’m an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]",
    "Stanley": "Don’t talk to me.[insincerely] Good to be back.",
    "Kelly": "[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn’t lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.",
