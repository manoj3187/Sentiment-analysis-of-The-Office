    "Michael": "It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]Why do you always say that? You’re gonna love it.[arriving at the first house] Alright let’s go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]Surprise!You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards![holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.[next house] Congratulations!We got it.Yeah that’s fine.[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house][giggles] Go go go go go go![arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I’ve never seen this place in the daylight.Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]Yes you did. That’s right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.[quietly shuts the door] Go.[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.You have big plans for tonight?You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn’t just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They’re like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!Black tie optional.A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody’s right. They’re like breadsticks on steroids. Right?So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I’m going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]Think of it as part of your training.[smiling] Okay, well we’ll work on it.You are doing it.[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn’t actually lose my keys…Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it’s all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!Jim, please no loopholes.This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?Good. Good. Good!Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don’t wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let’s try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can’t- [DeAngelo winces] That’s right, you’re not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.Say it with an accent![also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!I’m here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I’ve been here the whole time.[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There’s a live audience out there!No, Ryan would never do it. It’s too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It’s sort of our perk!Listen to me, you’re not doing this for me, you’re not doing this for you, you’re not even doing this for them![slaps him] You’re doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid’s menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It’s showtime. Get out there.Say it.You can do it, just say it.Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.Alright, here we go.Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]Well done.Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn’t be here tonight…Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald’s wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage][escorts Erin off stage] There you go.It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat][stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.Okay, we’re done! That’s it.We’re done. We’re done![Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it’d be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well…What?No, no. You’re being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.So what you’re saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I’ve fallen and I can’t get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.That got a big laugh.[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?We’re really close.That’s true, we wouldn’t get seats together.[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.What is your problem?!Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.He is in an all-out sprint.[in conference room] Here… [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]Oh, okay. [nods to him]Oh my God, something’s happening.[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].No it’s not.Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]",
    "DeAngelo": "Yes, and this happens every…?Well, you know, why don’t we try it, and if it goes good it’ll be part of my tradition.Thanks.Congratulations!Uh, leave it at the door or…?Is this an employee of ours?It reminds me of Katrina.Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?[whispers] I’m not going in there.Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay…[whispers to Michael] Michael, I’m very, very bad.That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-This did not happen.Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?Oh good!Where were you on September 11th?This is so weird! If I’m conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance… I-I fall apart. Obviously.[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo’s stomach bouncing up and down in Michael’s office] Me mo. Me mo.Meee Mo, Mee!When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door][bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!THE DUNDIES!Hello?Oh no!Billy Crystal?Neil Patrick Harris?Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies![in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?Mmhmm.Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?No one is listening to me! And I’m running out of time!Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.This was not, part of the job description!Who am I doing this for?I can’t. [Michael slaps him again]Stop, hitting me.Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?They say he’s going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn’t supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN’S ROOM!THAT’S WHY IT’S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING…This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It’s so much lighter!Michael, are we?!I know I’m the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael’s car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.I can just run over to the gas station.Okay, fine I’ll hold it.[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don’t stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you’re sitting in the backseat, baby.[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you’re going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. ‘Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door][falsetto] Measure your life in love![recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that’s so mean!",
    "Jim": "Yep, okay…Okay.No she doesn’t wa- She’s not here.Stay in bed!Having a great time.Thanks, yeah.Why don’t you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don’t understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.Who’s gonna see us?Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]I think I’m gonna go.I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!I’m sorry, that just wasn’t interesting to me.[shaking head at the camera]Nope, go back to the script.Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you’re watching this at home it’s way past your bedtime, by the way how’d this get televised?I don’t know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don’t know, I don’t know. Thank you!Didn’t I?I gotta go do this.I don’t know that we need to dissect it all now, but-That did. Pretty huge laugh.And impressions!You gotta play along man.",
    "Pam": "What’s going on?Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?You’re right, you’re right. I’m a middle class broad. [Jim does his “Jim face”]Yeah… [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?What’s wrong?Why don’t you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?Don’t you think it’s better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?What?Wait, when am I…? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don’t love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]You didn’t think to mention me huh?[annoyed] Why?Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!Let’s grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]In costumes!",
    "Stanley": "Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!I was.More meetings and-",
    "Meredith": "I’m so busted! Walk of shame!Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast![jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I’m not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!That is bull! [throws her Dundie]You hit me with your car!",
    "Erin": "Oh hey, didn’t see you.I don’t know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or… I don’t know. Maybe I’m going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]Get away from the car, he’s gonna see you.[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.I eat lunch in the car now.  It’s my alone time. It’s just nice to have some time away from Gabe.I, really don’t like spending time with him.Thank you Jim.I can’t just dump him Pam, I’m not like you, I can’t be mean.DeAngelo, Jo’s on the phone for you.Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I’ve ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don’t feel it. And I think that’s because I’m not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.I’m not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.",
    "Dwight": "Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.Every day is black tie optional!Always the padawan, never the Jedi.[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the…?Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?Big smiles folks! There they are.We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?I thought it was the worst Dundies I’ve ever been to.Gladly! I’d accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!I just don’t see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.And next time, why don’t you pick a co-host, that doesn’t have microphone-a-phobia!",
    "Kevin": "Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.[walks in] Hi!I brought them from home! Do you have a red?Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.For birthdays!",
    "Phyllis": "I love their breadsticks!I have diabetes too. You don’t see me making a big deal about it.",
    "Ryan": "I love when people say like crack when they’ve obviously never done crack.I don’t know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.Yeah that’s great.Why don’t you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I’m very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It’s, it’s so subjective.You helped me get off drugs!",
    "Andy": "Why don’t you think of hosting the Dundies like you’re just running a meeting.A lot of people I’d like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.",
    "Darryl": "Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?Damn that was cold.[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]",
    "“Jo”": "[Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We’re in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain’t got no host!Luckily I have someone for you!Better.He’s in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]",
    "“Angela”": "[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he’s a state senator.",
    "Audience": "[laughing]Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!",
    "Angela": "Oh wait, he can’t help because that title has no meaning!",
    "Oscar": "[laughing]Try Jim DeAngelo, he’ll be able to help.The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.I forgive you for kissing me![Toby is shaking his head, no] It’s his last Dundies.Come on Toby.",
    "“Jim”": "[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim’s actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don’t know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?",
    "“Phyllis”": "[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!",

    "Gabe": "What?[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I’m obviously really angry at Erin. It’s that quarter life crisis everyone’s been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I’m gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]",
    "All": "Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That’s how many minutes, that you’ve worked here.Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That’s like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.",
    "Toby": "In meetings.I really disagree with this. I think it’s kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man’s being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I’m not so sure he’s guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah:Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]",
    "Erin and Kelly": "And cups of coffee.",
