    "Dwight": "This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision Iâ€™ve ever made.My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but …I canâ€™t get it out. Try again!I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin…[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!But as Jim and I discovered…  No! … any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?What lab did these little clones escape from?Jim. Look Iâ€™m eating you.Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. Iâ€™m eating Jims.[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.Oh no, Iâ€™m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing][picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: Thereâ€™s a madman in our midst.Dumatril!Dumatril.This is a pill that I found here in the office. But itâ€™s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. Itâ€™s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] Itâ€™s for a disorder of the mind.Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane… [whispering] They are now off their meds.Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? Whatâ€™s going on Nellie? Talk to me.Iâ€™ll get my apprehension kit.Hi Daryl. Iâ€™m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound… crazy?So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?Is that where the nanobots like to come in?Is that how they like to get in?[whispering] I donâ€™t know. I just donâ€™t know.Hey.All right. All right, just …stay focused on the pill.You think I donâ€™t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes Iâ€™ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And neâ€™er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I donâ€™t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!Gotcha! Yeah! Letâ€™s see ya get out of this web, huh?What?Oh.I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.[whispering] I want some of those pills.Oh, no. No, no, no. no. Theyâ€™re not for me. Theyâ€™re for my cousin Mose. Heâ€™s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.Which one? Mose or the real Mose?He says Thank you.",
    "Erin": "[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight]Hey guys.Pam, what are you?No, Iâ€™m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.Uh, Jim, youâ€™re not dressed up at all.Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.[laughs][laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!Stop it stop it stop it stop it!What is with these turkeys?Hey! You better do â€˜Faith.â€™ You get me?So learn it. You all go to Cornell, youâ€™re like eight Rain men. Just learning the frigginâ€™ song.Buts… are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out… And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isnâ€™t stupid.The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think itâ€™s kind of pathetic. But when youâ€™re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.Are you okay?Okay![laughing] Yeah.Oh well, Andy, weâ€™re not moving to Cornell.Yeah.Oy. Andy, whatâ€™s going on?Well, um, you know maybe youâ€™re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just–Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.Oh.Whatâ€™s wrong?",
    "Jim": "It wonâ€™t budge.Ceceâ€™s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.Itâ€™s Okay.Sure I am. I am… one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?Thereâ€™s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.Gettinâ€™ a lot of mileage out of this, arenâ€™t ya?Are you sure youâ€™re okay with me putting in this much money.Youâ€™re the best.Okay. Iâ€™ll see you in a little bit.Shut up.Wow.Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?Oh, I actually talked to my wife and weâ€™d really like to uh you know, invest – get in on the ground floor.We were thinking somewhere between five – ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just – [blows air] – all in.All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.Oh man, it was great. They were great.I did, yeah.Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about… ten…Ten. It was the full ten.Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Itâ€™s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to…Yeah.What is it?Um, oh man, I donâ€™t actually know.They werenâ€™t really talking that much about money. They just said, Weâ€™re good with investing and then I…and I…No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.You werenâ€™t there.It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had…we should talk about it later.Pam.Weâ€™ll talk about it later.I thought that concert was pretty great.Angela, itâ€™s Halloween. You have to sing â€˜Monster Mashâ€™.Uh…Okay. Weâ€™ll, just forget it.Because it is Halloween. So if youâ€™re going to sing a concert, itâ€™s a good idea to throw that one in.",
    "Pam": "Hey.I am Dr. Cinderella.Iâ€™m an oncologist and you are a dog.So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.You were in an a capella group?Yeah. I mean, listen if weâ€™re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.I kind of am. Itâ€™s crazy.Okay.Okay I give up. What are you?[laughing] Gross. I love it.Hey, howâ€™d it go?Did you end up investing?How much?About ten?Wow.Wow.No yeah. Yeah.So did everybody …Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?What?They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?Talk about it now.Jim, that was most of our savings.We said some. We said â€˜some.â€™We said part not all.Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?No Iâ€™m just, Iâ€™m saying, what would happen if they didnâ€™t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?No! No, Iâ€™m interested. I mean I think everybodyâ€™s interested in why they have to sing it.Yeah, yeah, no, no. Itâ€™s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you canâ€™t do if you just keep singing â€˜Monster Mash.â€™",
    "Andy": "A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?Not a question.Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good!My Cornell a capella group.Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.Atta boy Clark!No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michaelâ€™s Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. Iâ€™m so not prepared.Ruh duh duh da dudes! Whatâ€™s up?I know that itâ€™s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, thatâ€™s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname “Boner Champ,” that is when I became me.You didnâ€™t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, nowâ€™s your chance! Iâ€™m here. You got Qs; I got As.No, I donâ€™t have AIDS. Thatâ€™s not what I said. Next question.[awkward silence]You donâ€™t have any– Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?Iâ€™m sorry, what?Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that youâ€™re Boner Champ.Did you maybe tell them that or…?Could you just call them and tell them the truth? ‘Cause I know itâ€™s really stupid, but itâ€™s also really, really, really important.Love you too.Yo! Bad boys of a capella.Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?Did he tell you how I got the name?Spring sing â€˜95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.They didnâ€™t know about the snowman story, and when I told â€˜em, they were not impressed.Right?Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!Oh Man! [clapping]No. Do not sing that. Do not… Oh man…Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?Thatâ€™s my signature song.Russell, Iâ€™m dressed like George Michael.Wha…?Shut up, Broccoli.You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A manâ€™s signature solo is his for life, okay? Thatâ€™s group policy and you know it.Just donâ€™t do the song anymore.Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!OK, fine, yeah. thatâ€™s one guyâ€™s opinion!Doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re the best singer ever. Dick.This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?Duh. I know. That would be insane.It could totally work though. I donâ€™t know why we wouldnâ€™t. Oh my god are we doing this?If I am not Boner Champ, I donâ€™t know who I am.Make a donation.Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?[HTC singing Cornell Alma Mater]My parents are broke.",
    "Angela": "The senator will be joining us later.No, it wasnâ€™t.And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway… Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!They lost me when they sang â€˜Monster Mashâ€™. That song obviously glorifies the occult.",

    "Nellie": "Iâ€™m sexy Toby.Something wrong Dwight?Yes?The mind is part of the body.Dwight, our co-workersâ€™ health issues are really none of our business so-Hm?Itâ€™s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and Iâ€™m not ashamed of that, But Iâ€™m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.Yeah, youâ€™re right. This man needs to be apprehended.You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.Hey Toby.Yes.Yeah. I…Yes. I thought Iâ€™d you know, be you.[laughing] Itâ€™s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]Okay, look Dwight, letâ€™s just call this thing off. I mean, itâ€™s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.The pill is mine.Get her out.Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? Itâ€™s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.Oh, well good for you. I mean, youâ€™ll need a prescription.Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that heâ€™s a good man and that I hope he feels better.The real Mose.",

    "Broccoli Rob": "[on computer monitor] Iâ€™m so sorry! I donâ€™t know how that could have happened.I just– I just started yappinâ€™ about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.Will do. I love you, Andy.[on flat screen tv] [singing lead of Faith][on screen] Heâ€™s still mad.Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 ccâ€™s of George Michael stat. So just… Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.Look, itâ€™s not my fault that I still live near campus, and itâ€™s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.I tell you what, weâ€™ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and Iâ€™ll do the same, and Iâ€™m so confident that Iâ€™ll win, I wonâ€™t even warm up.My pipes are primo, Champ. Why donâ€™t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?He said, and I quote, â€˜Hey Rob, nice pipesâ€™. That happened!That’s real.  ‘Thatâ€™ll never change!",

I guess you really are the Boner Champ.No.We donâ€™t know it.Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but–Now folks, by special request, weâ€™re going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room.Itâ€™s Mr. Andy Bernard!He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, hereâ€™s an old Treble classic.She said you wanted to hear â€˜Faithâ€™. Thatâ€™s Broccoli Robâ€™s signature song.I really didnâ€™t know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.I thought you were Adam Lambert.",
