    "Dwight": "Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.Yes.Yes. Yes.We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing – bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You’re gonna love ‘em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world’s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?Okay.Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.Perfect casting, right?Speaking of pimples, let’s release the BLOGGERS!Open the gates! There’s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There’s plenty for everyone!There’s plenty. Don’t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. There’s plenty of Pyramids.Oh, no, no, no. It’s good. It’s really — on the Internet, it’s a really — that’s a really good, good, thing.Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.Point it towards the store, idiot![laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is — damn it. Take over.Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.But you still work for Wired, right?Good! Okay. Flirt away.Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.I’m trying to make him feel important.Um… [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you’re so smart. You’re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.What’s a book? [giggles]Jim, get him a water.Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!Have you seen Erin?Oh God…  Hey no! Where do you think you’re going? You’ve gotta stay for the big presentation we’ve got this young wiz kid — Ryan. He’s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.It’s moments away. Just stay here!How long has he been in the bathroom?Jeez! What’s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]Are there any bloggers around?I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing… compared to this guy!That’s right. Will you just give us a second?Jim —Look at me. Look at me! Look… at… this… face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I’m telling you… if you don’t do this, [whispers] I don’t stand a chance. Please, Jim.Oh, my God. O… Kay! Go get into Ryan’s costume and check out his notes.Of course there’s a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There’s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.[Coldplay’s Clocks]It’s true.Yep.Psst.Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!Okay! Come on!Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!",
    "Ryan": "Are you holding this chair?‘cause I feel like I’m gonna fall off.I’m not wearing the right shoes for this.When people see this presentation, they’re gonna [bleep] in their pants.Sabre. It’s time to come home.Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?You know what?God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.You’re so ignorant. You barely know what you’re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.On my God. You’re so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though.And you know that I’m capable of this.What did you think of the presentation?Oh! “Fix” means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red![on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it’s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it’s different because it’s your wife?  Well, that doesn’t make any sense to me.Don’t talk to me right now. I’m sorry. I- I know you’re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don’t understand is… [voice fades][image on Pyramid] Sabre… It’s time… to come home.",
    "Erin": "Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.Hey, my name’s Tabitha. I’m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It’s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it’s working. There’s already people camped out behind me.I was ahead of you!Come on. I was in line before you.Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don’t want to leave yet. I haven’t had so much fun since seeing… zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.We are closed! Come on.Sorry about kicking you out. It’s just, we don’t want our brand associated with death.You’re not married yet?My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we’re not really friends.Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.",
    "Nellie": "Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I’m this patrician goddess. But here’s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than … what’s lower than dirt?Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn’t even get a callback.The black one. I never stood a chance.Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.Uh… that is excellent.I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.Yes!I wasn’t really sure which one of you is Chuck.Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? “Hello. Hi sweetie. It’s Jim. I’m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.”How you doing?[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.What is the delay here? Where’s Ryan? Why is he not here?What?You are gonna bloody ruin it. You’re gonna bloody ruin it because you’re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed…That’s….Dwight.  You’re the vice president.[squealing]aagh!",
    "Jim": "Which Spice Girl?Okay.Come on, man.[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?Uh, I – I gotta go. Okay.I’m very sorry.I’m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think …it seemed like you were a little nervous.Dwight.[ahem] You can… [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.You’re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one —About ten minutes.Oops, that’s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?It’s Ryan. “I’m sorry. I lied. I’m not in the bathroom. I can’t do it. I need to see my mom. I’m going home.”Uh…okay.I’m not doing the Presentation.Okay, I’ll do it.A costume?I’ve been in here for 20 seconds.I’m not wearing eyeliner.Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that — the only thing that remain — the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time — love, values, and of course, the pyramids — the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that’s —This… is the future, because… This is the past. I’ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I’ve seen drug addiction — unemployment. I’ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me.  I just wanted… to go home.  This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless… will be available in 2013.  You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything — in time… and space.Oh.All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.",
    "Todd Packer": "YepUh…I don’t see what that gets us, but I’m a team player.Schrute’s out to get me. But I’m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.",
    "Cathy": "Seriously disgusting.Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.So you’re a blogger right?God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I’m trying to be a good girl for once.",
    "Andy": "Morning, everyone.Don’t care. Tell me later.What do you got?Yes, I do. Phyllis.What?Here’s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam…They had, uh… weapons.I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.I didn’t do anything any of you wouldn’t have done.No.No, no, no, no, no, we don’t need to call the police. They’ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone’s business, right, Pam?And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why… Toby is giving us self defense training.Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?Great.What if you’re being attacked by a … smallish man who happens to not have a groin?What if you’re being attacked by a 4’11” man who is penisless?Why don’t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?[softly] Take that, kid.[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.[deep voice] Listen, I don’t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I’ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.Oh… [Kelly laughing]Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly… come on…. Ow! God! My good eye!You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn’t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, “Where were you when the girls came?”Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good!",
    "Kevin": "Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?Listen, it’s important. You’ve gotta hear this.I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?It’s not a kid on a bike. It’s a man in a car.Yeah [all murmuring]Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?Bye.Whether it’s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.",
    "Kelly": "Oh, my god!Will someone please explain what’s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it’s like my life is buffering.So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar — “How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.”No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.I was a twelve year old bully.Yeah, that’s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.Good. Let’s go.You think you’re so pretty!  Well you’re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore!",
    "Phyllis": "Do you have a black eye?Look, I don’t feel safe. I think we should call the police.",
    "Darryl": "Andy, who punched you?Guys, guys. That’s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.What?Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.",
    "Meredith": "Hey, I was on the can. What’s this about a black guy in the office?Ow.What the hell, Toby?",
    "Angela": "Black eye, Meredith.Yes.Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?Yes.Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.Good point? What is a tub of electricity?Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.Thanks.Let’s go Kelly.",
    "Pam": "That’s true.Weapons.But these were not the kind of people who use their words.Thank goodness he was there.Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.1-8-5-0-5.I just had a baby.Wow.How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I’m not laughing at you. I’m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier — yesterday. This morning.",
    "Oscar": "Good job Andy.How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?You’ve gotta be kidding me.No, Kevin — [sighs]With all due respect we know what we’re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.",
    "Man": "Quit it.",
    "Blogger": "Yeah. Blogger.Okay.Look at that guy. He’s got his Sabre phone on, and he’s not even using it.When’s the presentation?",
    "Toby": "Me?Yeah, um… I can’t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I’ll go put on my cup.Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So… strike, scream, and run. All right? Let’s try it.That may have been my fault.Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you’re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. “It’s all about the groin.”I don’t think that’s very common.Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.It’s interesting that you’re drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel… [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.All right, well, let’s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn’t everyone stand? Okay, so… you’re being attacked. You’ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you’re alive.There’s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.Okay, this isn’t over. Let’s stay focused, okay?  We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but… little things can be dangerous.Okay. Good point…I don’t… I don’t…I don’t know if this is gonna help…Uh…We should stay to maybe some more traditional models…Okay, this is what’s called pre-violent posturing.Okay, I’m at what’s called “the decision point.”",
