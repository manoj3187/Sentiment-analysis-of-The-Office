    "Michael": "Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he’s kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?That is ridiculous.Ryan’s about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I’m like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?Mmm… No. That was Yoda.There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one:You need to play to win. But… you also have to win to play.And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I’ve heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That’s rule number two.So what was rule two?Okay, well, let’s… . let’s kind of take it a little slower.Okay, uh, well, one is taken.Well, he needs a permanent number, right?Um, yeah.  Okay. That… No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.Rule number four. In business, image is everything – Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I’m seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So… oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. ‘M’ is for Murder, ‘P’ is for……for Phone. What?Um, oh, thinking about business school?Really?So you think you know a lot about business?Uh huh.Yeah. Quiz me.Come on, egghead. Let’s do it.Quiz me up.Uh…When I was Ryan’s age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe… lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I… can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it’s equal.Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.Okay, Dwight.You know what, Dwight? You don’t need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know… Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then… then you’d know what you’re talking about.For instance, why don’t you go to business…Stop. Dwight. You know what? You’re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He’s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He’s a valued member of this company… and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.I did not go to business school. You know who else didn’t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So… so it’s not the same thing. At all.Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?You are so smart. You are so eff-in’ smart. You should be teaching me.I became a salesman… because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but… You know? I’m very successful… your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?Nah, I’m okay.Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?Oh, I play this at home all the time while I’m falling asleep. What, uh… . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?Aaaall right. Who’s next, who’s next, who’s next, who’s? Jim? You’re next. Who would you do?Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. ‘Cause he is going to own his own business.Who’s, uh… Who’s next? Who we got? Whooo…Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So…What’s that?Yeah.Dwight. Hey!Dwight, don’t! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.I didn’t say it to him. I said it about him.[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don’t know either.Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It’ll make it easier for him to find.I gave it to you in the car.I saw you program it in.Okay. Alright.Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir…Dwight!? Great goin’. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What… Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don’t teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?Toaster Oven 101?Hey! I know what’ll impress everybody, I’ll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.[singing] …since the world was turning.Okay. Rule five – safety first,  i.e. don’t burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.Oh… look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.I’ll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.",

You know? Like, Stanley is the “crossword puzzle guy”. And Angela has cats. I don’t want to have a thing… here. You know, I don’t want to be the “something guy”.Yeah.[to Dwight] Don’t…That’s actually a test prep book.That’s a test prep for business school.I just got in. I applied, I go at night.Yeah.No, not yet.Just started.I… wouldn’t even know where to start.All right, um… Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.I am.I am.It’s a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.Maybe we should get some air.I’m really uncomfortable.[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk…  this is great timing.What’s your number?Um…You got to… you got to give it to me again.Now I have it.I am so sorry.I can’t believe I started the fire.I’m really sorry, Dwight.What?No.I’m really sorry, Dwight.",
    "Dwight": "Michael’s in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn’t evaluated me in years.Michael and I have a very special connection. He’s like Batman, I’m like Robin.

Um… Ryan needs his number for the count off.NO!Okay, he can have 14. Marjory’s not here today.Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.That’s funny, too. But if we’re the Three Musketeers…[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there’s a…Okay. Great, that’s going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question:is there fire wood on the island?Then I would bring an axe, no books.Fine. Physician’s Desk Reference.…hollowed out, inside:waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer’s Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question:did my shoes come off in the plane crash?Is this your car, Ryan?Good shocks.Do it.Keep an existing…Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn’t need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.Self taught. You didn’t even go to college.[scoffs] Come on. I’m studying with the master, huh?[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?Right?Stupid!The Crow.Why didn’t I go to business school?The temp.Yeah, it’s all him and Michael talk about anymore.He doesn’t even know that I do that.Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That’s going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.I’m sorry I said that, I didn’t… just part of me meant it. Besides, he’d end up being a hero anyway.Oh Jim, I’m not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.Would that make you happy?If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?I’m on it.[coughing][coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don’t teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.That’s exactly what I said.Were you absent?You failed?I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire”] Ryan started the fire!
