    "Karen": "So do you want to see it or not?Oh my God, you’re like, agoraphobic.Yeah.Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.Bye.  Ok, so this is what’s gonna happen.  You’re gonna suck it up.…and we’re gonna go to dinner.And then we’re gonna go to the movies.[shrieks]Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.Well, you know it happened so fast I didn’t really have time to be scared.Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.And he’s a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I’m not sure which one Jim hated more.Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.Hmm…  I don’t know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.",
    "Jim": "I don’t know.  Feel like… Friday night crowds…Agoraphobic?Really?Absolutely correct.Kev, have a good weekend.Here we go…Ok…Sounds good.Hey… [Roy lunges towards Jim]I guess… all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you… for stopping Roy.  Thank you.Okay.  Um… Got you something.You don’t know what it is.It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.Where’d you get that?Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I’ve been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.I can’t hear you.Still nothin’.No.Nice.Okay.And what happens in this one?Okay.Can I have a raise?[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.What?I didn’t say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.So, none of that tipped you off?Yeah, that was nuts.No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.We’ll see.  I’m sure you guys will… find you way back to one another someday.Oh, yeah.  Don’t worry about it.Ok, if you don’t want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.Boy I—It’s like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he’s like an eel.  I just can’t grab onto him.  It’s infuriating.Well… yes, that’s probably what it is.  So what do I do?Thanks, Kev.  I’m good though.What’s what?Wow.  I guess word got around.  That’s a nice… honor.[under his breath] Didn’t think you’d notice…[scoffs] I… will never say a word.  And now, we are even.",
    "Kevin": "Later, Jim.Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.You’re wearing a woman’s suit?Who makes it?Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend’s ass over another woman?Michael, here’s the, uh, $15 I owe you.Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So…[as Roy is walking out] Jim— Roy— Look out!",
    "Roy": "Hey Halpert![screams in pain] Ahh God![to Jim] Hey man, uh… I’m sorry. [Jim motions “Don’t worry about it”] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or… something?Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]I’m so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn’t gonna do anything.  But then I… kept thinkin’ about you two together, and…  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or… or maybe he was gay or somethin’… Not that that’s wrong.So you gonna start datin’ Halpert then?Oh yeah… Wait a minute, you… broke off our wedding for the guy.But you’re not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don’t get you Pam.",
    "Pam": "ROY!Roy don’t! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]I really don’t want to talk about it.  I don’t mean to be rude, but I just… I don’t want to comment on what happened.  It.Oh my God, that’s a woman’s suit!Michael, the pants don’t have any pockets.[Laughing, covering her mouth]It’s been a really rough couple of days… This helps a little.Sorry I almost got you killed.He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It’s just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?Not anymore.  It’s, um… It’s completely over now.Jim… I am really… sorry.I don’t know.I’m sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.Um… no.  No, he has a girlfriend.No, there were a lot of reasons.I know.",
    "Dwight": "Pam, please call security!Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who’s laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.Don’t want it.Don’t want it.  Won’t open it.  Don’t need it.  Won’t take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.No, don’t call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator’s eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what’s your angle?What’s this?Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  “Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute”Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There’s a teddy bear in a policeman’s cap.Really?Mm, good stuff.Sounds… fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]No need to thank me.I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who’s a real hero?  Hiro, from.  That’s a hero.  Also, Bono.",
    "Michael": "No need for consternation, everything is under control.It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.No…No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he’s just using this Roy thing as leverage.Yeppers.I don’t… remember.Yeesh…Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.Wikipedia.Wikipedia… is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.Hmm, well that’s interesting Darryl.  I think… [mumbling softly] that maybe you should… [mumbling jibberish]What I’m saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]Ok, see what I did?By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.Ok, let’s try another one.  Um…Walking out of the room unexpectedly.It’s a surprise.Go ahead, ask me for a raise.[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]What?No, what did you say?Oh it… sounded interesting… what you were gonna…[knock on door] Yeah.Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.You know what?  Actually, let’s go into the conference room.No, you know what?  Let’s stay here.  No let’s go… Yeah let’s go to the conference room.Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws ’em off.Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.[long pause] I am declining to speak first.Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don’t think corporate is going to go for this right now.What?No, this is a power suit.[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman’s clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.Ohh… kay.All right.Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman’s suit?No, I do, I, I wear men’s suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don’t think that this is totally just a woman’s suit.  At the very least it’s bisexual.Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side… that’s the mystery.Okay.Would you stop it, please?It’s European, OK?  It’s a European cut.No, they don’t.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]Italians don’t wear pockets.No, I don’t want to do that because I’m twice your size anyway.Um, let’s just do this in 15 minutes.Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver’s seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you’re dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman’s clothes.Let’s get down to business.  Why don’t you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.[mumbles jibberish][mumbling softly] That was a very good point.[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.Because, that is the way these things are done.  In… films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide— slide it, yes.Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.I… I can’t give you that, I— I don’t make this much.I don’t.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is… a pay stub.Plus perks, yes.Fourteen years.No, please, please…Ok, let’s take 15, again.A boss’s salary isn’t just about money, it is about perks.  It… for example, every year I get a $100 gas card… Can’t put a price tag on that.Oh, thank you.I didn’t give you $40.Okay.  Okay, here’s the straight… dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.Well what am I supposed to do?I’m not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.[exhales] That’s true.You know what?  I should.I have been a loyal employee for a long time.You know what?  I deserve a bump.I am makin’ it happen, sergeant.No, Jan.  I’ve never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I’ll leave right away.Yes, I’m bringing Darryl.Mm-hm.Hey, I’d rather kill myself.[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I’ve ever known.[sighs] Fine.Toby, come on.  Let’s go.Where?  I’m gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let’s go.Yeah.  Fine.[imitating Chris Tucker] Don’t ever touch a black man’s radio!  …Chris Tucker..  I won’t touch yours, by the way.Well…Mm, the Big Apple.Maybe I’ll stay.Well…[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I…Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.All right.Who’s the boy toy?Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.Pippity poppity.Six percent?  After all we’ve been through?I got you… jade earrings.No!No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?Why don’t you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I’m not going anywhere.Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I—Well that’s ridiculous I’m not gonna make—Ah, so…  All right, Levinson.  Here’s the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.But you just said 15.Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more… than just salaries.  It’s about perks.  Like having sex with Jan–Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can’t… I can’t dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can’t shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores… or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don’t know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s… socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn’t have to deal with Missy Elliot.",
    "Jan": "Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office![sigh] Is Toby there?Ok, what… what is the situation Toby?Thank God.All right, well are you gonna take care of this?What did I tell you about “yeppers?”I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?Why don’t we talk next month, after the quarter ends?Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our… you know, situation, we’re gonna need to have a third party present.Da— Darryl from the warehouse?No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.Michael, he’s your branch’s HR rep……and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don’t do it.Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.That’s my new assistant.I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First— [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.Oh, God.Michael—Michael—Okay, Michael.  Please, why don’t we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.Ok, Toby, how about if you…Great.What’s wrong with you?Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.No, just… I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?No.  But we can offer you 12.Michael!",
    "Toby": "I’m… here, Jan.Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won’t press charges against Roy or the company.Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his…Which is where?Thanks Dwight.Can you stop…There’s a bunch of people back here, maybe…Guys…I don’t think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.Where?Alright.No.How would we get home?Hi, Jan.Just preparing for the deposition.This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.Sure.",
    "Oscar": "Angela, Roy’s check.  He’s coming in later to pick it up.It was crazy.Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy’s by reception and you could just tell he’s gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight’s standing there like an action hero.It was insane!",
    "Angela": "You saw it?  Describe it please.Oh…[flustered] Well… good for Dwight.What happened, exactly?  I wasn’t here, so I haven’t really heard the whole story.Mm-hmm.[flustered] Goodness.You’re useless.Then what’d he do? [Kelly’s phone rings]Dwight.  Dwight.  I’ve been doing some very interesting reading.Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could… read it together.",
    "Kelly": "That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.Oh it was?Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer’s in your apartment in the middle of the night……and you call me, to calm you down……you can just call somebody else ’cause I’m not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I’m not.I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!You are so mean.Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.Oh, so I’m crazy now?And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like “No!”You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone’s stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams…",
    "Ryan": "I can’t imagine what I would have done.Well that was funny, that’s why.Mm-hmm.Okay.You know what?  I didn’t—Well, don’t talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night…I don’t know what you’re talking about.No, I said your idea was stupid.Don’t you see why that’s insane?",
    "Darryl": "You ready for me?Cool.Okay.Okay, I’ll start.  It’s pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I’m scheduled to get one in six months, but I’d like that to be moved up to now.Are you wearin’ lady clothes?Are you wearin’ lady clothes?  Those look like lady… pants.That there’s a woman’s suit.I’ma call Roy, man.This is gonna make him feel better.This is too good.Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.Well, it’s simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we’re shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I’m pickin’ up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin’ a raise.What?  I can’t hear you.I can’t— what, Mike?  Are you—Why can’t I just… tell you?There you go.I am serious, Mike.  That’s a 10% raise.  That’s what I want.Come on, be for real Mike.[laughs] Are you serious?  You’re earning this?Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]Ho-ho!Oh, I’m sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs][on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]What?That’s ’cause of you, Mike.  They’re not gonna give the workin’ man more than the boss.Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.Well, when they merged the two branches together, they putin charge.  Okay, and we’re shippin’ more now than we ever have.Yeah that’s true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.Yeah, you should.Fourteen years long.Make it happen, cap’in.Comfortable, Mike?How about you, man.  Comfortable?Thank you.I haven’t been to New York in a long time.Maybe I’ll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.Oh you could stay too.  He’s got a big place.Mm, it’s not that big.Busses, though.  They get you home quick.Okay, bring it home now.  And don’t forget the new black man phrase I taught you.Yes sir.  Remember that.  I’ll be right outside if you need meYeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I… just can’t help myself.",
    "Phyllis": "Look, it’s got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?Did you see…Mm-hmm, near the river.Four.",
    "Stanley": "You must have been scared out of your mind.Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he’s way overpaid.So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?Mm, how many bedrooms?",
    "Creed": "Here’s the $40 you gave me.In a way you did.I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin’ about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter—",
    "Hunter": "Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.",
    "Andy": "I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I’m back.  Got a second chance, and I’m not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out… in a fun way!  You know, not like, I’m gonna hurt you…Hey guys!  Guess who’s back! [Dwight pepper-spray’s Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!"
