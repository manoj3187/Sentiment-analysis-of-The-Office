    "Jim": "I’m taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.It’s great.But that doesn’t matter. This does. It’s the only thing that matters. We’ve had some really nice days together.Beesly! Oh, my god.Ah, definitely blue.For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin—Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can’t give 100% to two things at once you know.Huh. Well, you know, you can’t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what’s most important. That’s my new thing.Smasher!Fireball!That’s pretty good. I feel safe.Oh, Clark. I’m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.What?Okay. The annex it is. I’ll be sitting at your desk if that’s okay with you.Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.Oh, wow. But, um—Oh, I get that.I get it.Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don’t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that.Again.Not at all. It should be Dwight.You’re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don’t want to meet that person.Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.If you could help me out, that would be—Anything would help.Oh, also, while you’re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.Wow, that’s—You come so prepared. Aspirin.Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It’s really great.No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Just saying.Wow, hey.What’s up?Okay.Really?Yeah, totally you did.I need you to stay right here while you think about it.All right? I’m gonna wait.I’m sure you did not. What was your question?Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I’m waiting.Look who’s back.Weeknights are actually tough just because—That’s true, yeah.[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.So.Let’s hear it.Nope. Can’t accept that job. It’s not a real job.I’ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I’d be proud to take.Don’t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.Oh, don’t look at me cause I think you’re making a terrible choice.You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What’s up?What kind of offer?What?Oh, my god!Wow, that is… wow.Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that’s gonna take?Oh, man. Yeah, I can’t do it.This, man. I can’t do this to Pam.I know. And I can’t do it.",
    "Pam": "It’s great.The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.Nice morning, too.Wow.it’s okay. You can sit in the annex.I’ll come visit you.Oh, Andy.Yes. Yeah.Oh, boy. Um—I could give you some beginner stickies?Here you go.Mm-hmm.It’s all yours.Hey.Hi.Um, I have a question.Oh, I had a question.I did!Super important.Okay.All right. I did not come back here just to see you.I don’t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.Exactly.I’m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it’s like a double date.Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.Oh, well, Thursday’s tough, because of—They are.What’s going on?[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.It’s nice to have you back.",
    "Andy": "Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent’s putting me up for a furniture commercial.Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what’s up? Back in the small pond?Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.Tell me about it, you know? I’ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don’t know if I’m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.David Walrus, in his native habitat.Yeah.I’m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I’ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don’t—it just… I owe it to myself and my future fans.Thank you, David.Nope. I have made up my mind. I’m really sorry.Thank you. Not gonna need it.Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I’m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.I wasn’t fired. What are you talking about? I’m fired up, yes. Guys, I’m—I’m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.Yeah, so, I’ll see you on the red carpet. See, that’s how it works.I’m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?All right. I get it.The male is a funny species. We don’t just tell each other how we feel, that’s chick stuff. So instead of saying, “Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don’t want you to leave.” You say something like, “Hey, Andy, you’re making the worst mistake of your life. You’re not talented.” Well… right back at you, Darryl.[hugs Darryl] I’m gonna miss you too. Mmm!It’s now or never.Yeah, sure. What’s your question?Well, it’s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?Nah. I like my plan better.What?Well, hello.Big day for you.Love the belt.You know, I don’t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog’s outta here, so letting it all hang out!Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.I’m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That’s something you can’t take back.Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?Thank you. [steps into conference room]Thank you. [leaves]Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I’m gonna stay on in sales.Okay.Death of a salesman.Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman’ by Arthur Miller, it’s a great play about crushed dreams.[sits at Dwight’s desk] Got any hot leads?Brava, brava.How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It’s cause I had a fallback. That’s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it’s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.Everyone! Changed my mind again.Uh, dream. Goin’ with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn’t that right, Jim?All in! Whoo!Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.Yeah, but here’s the thing. I can’t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I’ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.Seriously?Come on, just do it.All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby’s thighs]God, Toby, don’t—stop blocking my hand.This is your—you brought this on.Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I’d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.’ [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she’s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I’m doing the right thing.Yeah.Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don’t squash my knickety-knacks on top.Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too—But I just—it’s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn’t…Rehash—Exactly.Thanks, Angela. You too.A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.Tuna, I’m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ‘I Will Remember You’—everyone is slightly impressed]",
    "Oscar": "[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?That’s—that’s awful, Angela. I’m so sorry.Angela, you still have your son.I can’t say we didn’t see it coming. But it’s a sad day when anybody is fired. We’re so sorry, Andy.No, I don’t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can’t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?Hey, I didn’t get a chance to say it, but… congratulations, Dwight.Good night, Kevin.Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.Wait a minute. You’re not thinking of living in a—Okay, I’m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.Come stay with me.I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won’t be long. It’s the least I could do.Separate bathrooms.You’re welcome. Let’s go get Phillip. Then we’ll get your stuff…And get you the hell outta that place.Oh, Angela.No, it’s neat and tasteful, like most gay men’s homes. The stereotype holds up.Angela, you just were—I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can’t—",
    "Angela": "No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.Two sacks’ worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.It’s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She’s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.And they’re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.I guess.Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.Yes. Congratulations.This is a big day for you.[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there’s a problem it’s clearly on your end. And—oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then… um… what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn’t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should’ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]Andy.What are you doing?Yeah, okay. That’s not what I mean. You don’t have to leave because you said you would. Don’t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It’s not worth it.Ugh.No, that’s not—No, none—No, stop. It’s just—Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.Thanks.[crying] It’s just a really nice song.Well, I’ve changed my mind.Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?Oh, god.You don’t want me at your place.Well…Thank you.Okay.Are you allowed to have pets?So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?I wouldn’t know. I never lived with a gay guy.[starts sobbing] I love him.No, not the senator. I love Dwight.",
    "Kevin": "Wait, all of them?I’ve never met anyone like that.Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don’t know. You know who’s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can’t fly right. I’d pay to see him. But I don’t have to cause the park is free!Our question is—it seems dumb.Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You’re too character-y to be a lead and you’re not fat enough to be a great character actor.Ooh, there’s a great play about a salesman.I don’t think so.No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.Dwight’s the new manager. He freaking did it.Yeah, and Dwight, I’d like to be the first to say congratulations.What do you think that was about?[everyone applauding] Awesome!Night, Oscar.",
    "Dwight": "Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—Smasher? No, where’d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city’s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don’t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.Ah! [throws punch] That’s how it’s done.He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]Just slip it off my—Slip it off my hips.He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.There it is. [everyone applauds]We did it, we did it. I love you.Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You’re gonna watch me right?Sensei, you’re not watching.Watching?Watch this part, okay?You did not just say that! You don’t know Pam. She is really cool.Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It’s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I’d be happy to see Jim as manager.You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager’s job?Yeah, right. I’m afraid that ship has sailed.Hello.Big day for you.Thank you.Oh, yes.This is exciting! You’re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.Oh, I doubt you’ll make it. Very few do who’ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you’ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don’t quit your day job.You’re bad.Say it again.Where?What branch?I’m sorry. I’ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.But this isn’t interim manager. No. It’s Dwight K. Schrute… [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.I will never, ever let you down.David. Can I just do one thing while you’re making this announcement and then I’ll never, ever do it again?It’s just one thing. Just let me—let me do this—Just wait and send it to voicemail.Come on. Come on.[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]Pam.Thank you, Jim.Get out of Jim’s seat.You’re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we’ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.So…I wanted to offer you a new position.Assistant regional manager.Jim.Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.So, all the numbers adding up?Thank you.Yes, it is. Carry on.[whispering] You okay?Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.",
    "David Wallace": "Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?This isn’t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, “The kind that’s good for head shots.” And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it’s gonna boost office morale. Now, he’s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.Andy—Uh-huh, but—So you think you’ve been too focused on your job?So you—you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?Uh, well, I guess I can’t stand in the way of a man’s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.There’s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?Well, good luck.Okay.Well that kind of worked out.Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?He said that? He’s an odd guy, isn’t he?Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn’t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.Again! And I’m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?You sure?Yeah.You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?Will you be the new manager?Where?Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let’s go. It’s good news.What?Why do you already have this?I know.I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight’s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You’re gonna do great.Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute—I don’t think so.Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight—[phone buzzes] Oh, I’m sorry, I gotta—This’ll be a second, sorry.Yeah.[on phone] Then we’ll get him a new set of drums.We put the past behind us, though, Andy.Enough, Andy. Enough!Oh my god.",
    "Erin": "Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said “is Indian” and was like, “Is Indian what?” Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy’s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.Yes, there’s Andy! Andy is in. I’m a good receptionist, I know he’s in.So true. Is there a question, or are—what?Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.I had no idea. And here I’ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin’ sheep.Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That’d be fun.Well, how about Thursday?Just forget it. Forget I said anything.",
    "Creed": "I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]",
    "Clark": "Right. Yeah. But, you know, I’ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I’ve earned this. I mean, you know?Right. Well, I’m here to sell paper.All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And—and Wallace is here today. And I don’t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?That’s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete’s beautiful, dead eyes.Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.All I’m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager’s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.Congrats, Dwight.But I fought for this seat.",
    "Phyllis": "Andy sings beautifully. And he’s really good at dancing. He’s a good speaker. But there’s just something there you don’t want to look at.What’s it now, dream or no dream?Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He’s not terrible.No, he’s good.",
    "Pete": "Yeah, a little bit.Oh, no, no, no. No it’s cool.It’s cool, man. I’m sure you and I will have our own thing.See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]",
    "Darryl": "I just think you’re going into this a little fast.Show business is cold. Let’s say you get a job, which you probably won’t. They’re not gonna cut you any slack. You’re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.You talk to Wade and Colin?We got an offer on the table.A buyout.We’re in play, baby.We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it’s not just a Philly play, so get this: they’re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.Yeah, we did it.Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.Can’t do what?No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.",
    "Stanley": "Andy’s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?Can’t you just leave?Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.He was good.",
    "Sensei": "I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.It’s not a large room, I think they heard me.That’s really ok. I’m mostly focused on the belt here.Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can’t—I can’t do this if you’re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we’re gonna have to cut this off.Congratulations.Okay.Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]Yeah, I’m watching. Just do it.I’m watching.Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he’s one of the most tenacious and determined men I’ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]",
    "Esther": "Oh! I’m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.",
    "Nellie": "Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and “full-ass” it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.Oh, good lord.",
    "Meredith": "Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don’t want to see you in a porn next year.",
    "Toby": "Okay, then, Andy.Andy, you know I can’t do that. It’d be lying.Yeah, I’m—I can’t.[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.No, no.No, no. Andy."
