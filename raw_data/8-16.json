    "Dwight": "Pretty good.[laughing] That’s not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you’ve got so much on your plate. Right now, you’re like ‘oh, what’s more important? Dwight’s question, figure out who’s the VP?’ Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-That’s a hobby, unless it’s for food.Waste of time.That’s just a verb.Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.English peoples’ main use today is judging American talent.

[Continues seagull calls]Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] â€¦ahhmmmâ€¦ excuse meâ€¦ What?! Not now, I’m busy.Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh noâ€¦ Freak, I need a favor.I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.You really want Packer as your boss?If Jim has bedbugs, that means they’re everywhere. I can’t risk them coming back to Schrute Farms.

Did it seen sleepy?Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?Pshh. That’s a bedbug.Everything’s a joke.Check your hair! [checks Jim’s hair]God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.You are clean. Okayâ€¦ One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we’ll see who’s laughing. [dastardly laugh]Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!Let the bedbugs bite!We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.Nope, I wasn’t bitten.Oh, it’s plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.If there were any in here, They would’ve imbedded themselves in me.No, you’re good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.No, that’s the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.Such a chorus girl.Euughhâ€¦ Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is presentâ€¦ Hey.Okayâ€¦ Seven, one, one, nineâ€¦No, okay.Try againâ€¦ Ugh, I’m still getting numbers!

[Dwight and Nellie kiss]â€¦ Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie][in voiceover] Win at all costs, don’t respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that’s how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where’s the bug?[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back![continues spraying the bed] It’s a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid’s cart!I think I saw it!You can’t stay here, this place is a biohazard.
