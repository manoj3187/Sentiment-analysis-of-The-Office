    "Michael": "So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.Don’t worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are… the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.You know what? That’s a nice attitude, Ryan, I’m just helping you invest in your future, my friend.Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? …Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we’re all going to make. It’s not a pyramid scheme, it is a… it’s not even a scheme per se, it’s… [Jim draws a triangle around Michael’s diagram] … I have to go make a call.Oh ho ho! What?Thank you! That’s really nice.Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don’t know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have aice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher.What’s up?Ah, thank you sir.[Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.Ohh, god.No no no, no, new suit, please.Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually— no, Bulgaria.Good luck. One of a kind.Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They’ve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.Don’t! Nope! Please, don’t want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.Let’s get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in][answering phone] Yeah?Oh, great, put her through.Hey, you.It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.Really? ‘Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.Thanks. [grins]Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up][to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] …You can take a five, if you want.Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!Thanks.Somebody got donuts for my birthday!You didn’t know it was my birthday.Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].Mmm.Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman’s pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a… is that alright?[laughing] Okay. I’m so nervous.When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids… and… I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me… for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?Yeah, well, it’s on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.You’re making it worse. I bet Luke Perry’s friends don’t treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].What?[grinning] Ohhh, God.Ohhh, no.Ohh, no, no, no! I can’t… Ryan, come on. Let’s do this.Okay.Thank you.Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it… please.Get in here… everybody.Birthday party subs! My gift to you.The best.Yes.Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.Just the bread, it’s fresh baked.Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn’t even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So…was the worst birthday I think I ever had.Kevin? Respect the birthday please.Are you done? …Good. Okay.Uhhh… blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm… [blows out the candles]… I asked for trick candles.Okay. Well, when she comes back we’ll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven’t had a hug all day.… Aww, that… sucks, great. … Wow, that’s good timing. That’s… that’s, sorry, that’s terrible. Terrible news. That’s terrible… terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.Yeah, but it’s not brain cancer. And it shouldn’t stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.And laughter… also.Why are you here? I didn’t even invite you to my birthday party.[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn’t speak for everybody and I am your boss, I… think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.Well, you’re pretty much driving everyone else here crazy… crazy with worry.Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we’re going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.How dare you sir. You are gross.[sees ‘Happy Birthday Michael Scott!’ poster at skating rink] That should not be there.No, it’s alright. It’s already up. Just leave it. Where’s Kevin? Come on! Let’s get our skate on!Yeah, I’ve been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you’re on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin… um, it’s pretty scary. And I’m thinking that uh, next time you’re in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.Kevin. You heard anything yet?Okay. Well. Live strong.Alright.Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or…Oh, these… all your kids?Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin’ now!Push. Good! That’s great. You got it. [Kevin’s phone rings] Excuse me.Oh… God… [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We’re gonna beat this, okay? We’re gonna… come here [hugs Kevin].Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would… be… chaos.Okay, who’s this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.Thank you… Dwight. That’s great. Thanks.Yeah.Oh! You didn’t need to do that. …Nightswept. This is… really amazing. Thank you. I love it.",
    "Oscar": "Who is this guy again?This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.Skin cancer is treatable.It’s going to be okay.…I’ll do it.It wasn’t me.What is this?",
    "Ryan": "Who uses calling cards anymore?[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.",
    "Toby": "Didn’t you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?Who brought in donuts?Happy birthday!I… guess I forgot.Are you serious?[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee’s plan? Our health plan is s… just… it’s terrible.I don’t really think people are in the laughing mood.I work here.",
    "Jim": "No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?Hey. …Oh, happy birthday.Man, I’m so sorry. When do you find out?Oh, okay.Kelly, you know what…Sometime today.Maybe, but… we’re gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and…So. We got Kev some stuff. Um… a party pack of M&M’s, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won’t get that back.Which we realize sounds crass, but, it… is his favorite number.[puts fabric softener into cart] …What?Yeah, you don’t?…Okay.Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.Just… quit stalling.Such a dork.How old are you?Well that’s an invasion of privacy, so, I’m going to tell Michael.You… owe me.Think you can let go?Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]Is that Michael?…It’s something to think about.",
    "Pam": "Happy birthday Michael.I said happy birthday.One’s good.Michael wants a strippergram?Michael, I have Jan on the line.I can sign for it.When does he hear?Ohh… poor Kevin.If I knew I had a week to live, I would… probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And… I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. …It would be a pretty busy week.…I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?Sixty-nine cup of noodles.And his favorite lunch.You use fabric softener?No, I do.[checking watch] We should probably head back.You dare me? How old are you?[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you…Oh I’m sorry. I’m sorry.I hate you.No. [laughs]Who is that?I got it.Michael?This is from all of us.Michael’s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don’t know… It was a good day.",
    "Meredith": "Did you hear anything yet?",
    "Kevin": "No. I’m still waiting.They said this afternoon. They’re waiting on a second opinion.Um, I might have skin cancer.Right.Hello? Hey.No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.Still scary.Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.If I go home now, I’ll just drive myself crazy.I can’t relax about it, you know?No, not yet.Okay, Michael.Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.",
    "Dwight": "Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!Birthday hug!That suit is amazing.Mmm. Maybe I should get one.Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the…Let’s get the party started. [Begins ‘raising the roof’]Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]Yes, but he doesn’t want to know when, or whom.It’s ‘For the Longest Time,’ by William Joel. It’s you favorite song.I probably care more than she does.Uh, that’s a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back… order… [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother’s vaginal canal, so… huh?!

Stanley!On three, we’re going to hoist away! Ready?Happy birth moment, Michael.One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]Oscar…Okay, that isan eight foot sub.F. Alright, what’s the damage?[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine… sixty.Why tip someone for a job I’m capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because… I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.Here they come.Come and get it!Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.Oh. I got it.[whispering] This is the most important day of the year.

Thank you.What are— it’s… the party planning committee.Fine.Yes… [whispering] but don’t expect any cookie.[whispering]No one cares about your birthday.
