    "Dwight": "[knocks water bottle on to Jim’s desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you’re in a suicide cult.Oh yeah?That’s right Jim.[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.No. Putting a load on more like it.Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again][to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!Oh that’s real creative.I could, but I just don’t feel like it loser.Standing.Don’t!Standing.I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?Well today’s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?Your path from obesity begins right here!Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.Maybe you do. Hi. I’m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It’s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.It’s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.That is true.That’s me.Maybe over a beer after she’s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].Ready? What do you think?You haven’t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let’s go over membership. I’m going to need the first month’s and the last month’s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month…Darryl… [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.Kelly?That’s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.What do you think you’re doing?I build you this temple to the human body, and you’re lifting what, five pounds?I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?Eight minutes!Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I’m gonna make you look like Lebron James!That’s what I said.I know.This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.First thing, we’re gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!You’re nothing! You’re so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!All right, I’ll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?What do you want!?!Val Kilmer? I don’t buy it. That doesn’t make any sense. Wow… I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.Hey, what are you listening to?There is no shower.What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I’ve already covered the BM of it all. It’s miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",
    "Creed": "No. No. No. You’re way off on that one.Okay. What about your friend?",
    "Oscar": "Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.All I need is another gym. As if I don’t have enough drama.Who’s spotting who? Don’t use the bike in the corner. That’s Bruce’s. Jeremy says…Andy, if he didn’t want her working here then why did you hire her?How mean are we talking about?That’s Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]Yeah, he’s in a ladle.He did it himself.Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.It’s not that kind of ladle.[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I’m sorry, I’ve got to recharge this.You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!",
    "Jim": "Hey guys let’s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight’s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he’s never, ever going to go back on it right?[sees a pole poking out Dwight’s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight’s wallet]Prank! [throws money from Dwight’s wallet on the floor]You know what it’s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?Because you’re sitting?Ok.Because you’re sitting?You know I have to do this.I think you could just do Andy Bernard.I don’t know. He wasn’t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn’t hire his wife.Well it’s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.Well it’s not that easy. It’s kind of sometimes difficult.No, I don’t think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it’s doing.Oh, wow. So cute.Very cute. [holds out the phone][to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open… uh, okay. [runs][shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?Oh boy.Do I?[mutters] I know, I do.I really wish I could help. I’m not really sure how I can…That’s the thing. See, I didn’t want to get in the middle of this. Still don’t. But here’s something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.Perfect!Yes?[sighs] I don’t know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I’m here. And between us, she’s on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don’t know how this helps, but it’s just what I’m thinking.Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I’m not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley’s tie is really the story of the day…Ok, so that’s a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It’s pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I’m Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I’ll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]",
    "Darryl": "Hey man.Taking a load off huh?Good luck with that.You don’t have to say it if you’re doing it.Uh weight lifting yeah.I’ll take a look.I’ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn’t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I’m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.Make a real gym.Getting my sweat on.I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.No.Dude, I’m gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I’ll start slow.It’s Lejon Brames.You know, get it right.Yeah, I’m gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.Okay, I’m not doing that.Looks that way.This doesn’t help me. I don’t respond to that kind of strategy.Dwight, come back and spot me.To push this bar up.Help me!To look good for Val!",
    "Andy": "[signing his name] Andrew… Baines… Bernard.Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it’s like taking a test, but I know the answers.What was that?Hey there. It’s a pleasure.I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We’re 100 percent staffed up.Alright.Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.We will start here at Erinville.Reception. Your classic one-man operation.I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.I’ll explore exploring it.Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?Jim?You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.Dwight why don’t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they’ve ever been to me. What I wouldn’t give for one of Phyllis’ classic room clearing farts right now.But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.Those are fully staffed as well.[laughing nervously] Yes.Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-There are lots of considerations.Alright. Well then welcome aboard.We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?Hi gam-gam.Are you taking your med-meds?We promised we’d never say goodbye.[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn’t want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.I am not asking, I am ordering.It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you’re up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.[in robot voice] What is going on?Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don’t you?Why would you say that?It’s not that, exactly.Let’s just say that if you don’t want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.I don’t know. [chuckles]Yes! The dude is an enigma.Ah… [stammers][to Susan] Cameras…It just was one of those things-Yes?No games?Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, “in four seconds, my wife’s gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.” [laughs]I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.No, it’s not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.[grabs Jim’s leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don’t! Damn it, Tuna!Jim, I’ve had enough of your unhelpfulness.[laughs] I think we’ve got ourselves an answer.That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.Uh…Yep.Hey, Mrs. California.You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.Yeah.Yeah.Who knows?Totally.Hmm?So, Roberto Californio doesn’t want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that’s impossible.Ugh! He’s always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?",
    "Robert": "[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?Everyone. I’d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she’s here today to see if there’s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she’ll shine.Andy. Let’s see if there’s a good fit first. Then we’ll talk.Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn’t you agree Andy?Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I’ll just duck out and run the company for a while.Are you telling me that there’s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.I would be eternally grateful. It’s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.[on phone] Say hello grandma.Hold one finger up to Susan. You’ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, “are you taking your medicine?”Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We’ll fix this.[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife… has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you’ll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.[enters] Oh, still here. Terrific.Well that’s a shame.Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?What’s the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.Absolutely.No games.Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It’s gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.Andy, just answer the question.No games.You lying son of a bitch!Tell my wife you’re lying.This is preposterous.Let’s get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where’s Jim?Can you call security, tell ’em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.[sees Jim’s abandoned car] That’s weird. Well, he’s gotta be around here somewhere.Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape]So I think you know what we want to know.Yes.No.All right. Thanks.Yeah.[claps Andy’s shoulder] Heh.I love my wife.This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.",
    "Ryan": "That’s why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They’re not going to know what hit them.Actually Ryan.Bitttch!",
    "Susan": "Hello. Oh call me Susan please.Hello nice to meet you.Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.Oh, Ryan.Hi.I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.Well make that a red wine and I’ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there’s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don’t we just let it go.So what happens next?You didn’t say goodbye to your grandma.Who walks around with their passport?Have you had any?Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don’t have a computer.Oh, that is so cute-Excuse me, waiter, there’s a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]Aw, let me see-I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss’ wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.Your employees don’t seem to be taking to me.Do you not want me here?It’s okay. I understand. I’m not sure how I would feel about having the boss’ wife work for me either.But it is something.Why would you not want me working here?I think I understand what you’re going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can’t he?Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn’t he?Got it.Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.You sure about that?No games?Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.Andy?Why do you keep looking at my husband?That’s not true, is it?Robert…For God’s sake, did Robert tell you that he didn’t want me working here?Jim…Answer the question, please.[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]Andy.Hey. Uh, I’m sorry about the position you were put in today.Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.Well, different circumstances.Who knows?Maybe after all this settles down…It’s a date.",
    "Erin": "Hoo-hoo!Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]Well that’s a sales desk.That’s adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?He just rolled out and crawled out.Um, where’s the shower?",
    "Phyllis": "We have a gym at home. It’s called the bedroom.[grabs phone] Aw… He’s so tiny. Is he in a ladle?Is that ladle stainless or…",
    "Angela": "Enough Oscar, enough.This is all pathetic.",
    "Kelly": "I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.",
    "Toby": "Did you bring your passport with you?Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.No.",
    "Andy/Oscar": "it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.",
    "Kevin": "How can we do that? She’s simply wonderful.Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I’m gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don’t. Know.",
    "Gabe": "I didn’t know Darryl joined.Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting…uh, a very nice young woman.Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I’m fine. [grunts]",
    "Meredith": "Gotta get in shape. I’m doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.",
