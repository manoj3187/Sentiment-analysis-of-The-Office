    "Dwight": "What is this?You’re so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?Yeah, no such thing.  They don’t give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I’m gonna take it apart in about five minutes.Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my — [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it’s a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: “My horn can pierce the sky”.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn’t that right princess? [makes doll nod]I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?They are now.All right.Oh, so glad I could help.Merry Christmas.Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]Aye.No, I like Meredith.Actually, I don’t care for Meredith, but I don’t believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.She is a hazard to the other people of the office.I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.Oh right, that’ll take a couple of weeks.Really?$200.Oh, that’s my last one.Not my problem.Well don’t look so surprised.",
    "Jim": "Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.I think it’ll take you a little longer than that.Ah. You brought in your doll collection.That’s the Christmas spirit.Yes.I will grant you one wish.Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.What is it?Wow, that is delicious.Can’t believe no ones thought of that.[Meredith’s hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!Ah… would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?That’s cool.Well what if we can’t do it quickly.Yeah.Yeah, but you’re gonna need a permit for that.Michael, I think… you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They’ve been in there for 45 minutes.[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.Do you take requests?Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.You did not know it.Everyone knew some of it.You knew it.She knew it.",
    "Stanley": "Eh…I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]I agree.Mmmm… chewy.",
    "Phyllis": "I’m sorry.  It’s the largest one I have.This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is “Nights in Morocco”.  This isn’t your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she’s from Morocco, in which case it’s very accurate.Yes.Angela. You’re going to move this for the party right? It’s not on theme.Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.I need you to get rid of the tree.Thank you.Oh, I don’t think it’s blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won’t tell everyone that she’s cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.It looks like we’re going to be here for awhile, so why don’t you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.And napkins… fanned.I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don’t think they’re appropriate anymore.Oh, sorry, it’s your job.You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren’t you wearing the hairnet?Ok… nice.That’s a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.I didn’t ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.Excuse me?Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela’s having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby’s going away party.",
    "Michael": "Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.Alright… One more time around the block.Jim, Jim….That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice…ka.Yeah.I know.[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn’t left India.Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teethNo, no. I celebrate privately.Why don’t we just do it now? We’ll do it quickly.We’ll do it quickly.[mimicking] What if we can’t do it quickly? What if we cant do it–Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.An intervention.  It’s sort of hard to describe, but really its– it’s a coming together… it’s a surprise party for people who are– who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.Okay, how do you feel?Uck… T.M.I.Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]The aye’s have it.Alright, well, let’s look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?I got it on a website, that’s not important.Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I’m doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here’s what I’d like to do.  I’d like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I’ll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That’s how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith’s drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don’t say anything she’s not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.That’s– you didn’t– you weren’t hurt by that.Okay, no, that’s not what we’re going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith’s drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don’t you have anything?Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey– come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.I want you to say I’m an alcoholic.You can say it as loudly as you want, but we’re not going to believe you.[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you’re dead?Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.Dwight–[sighs]…okay.Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It’s Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That’s my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I’m not going to wish that on her. I– a watch would be nice.[whispers to Meredith] I’ll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?We did?Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we’ll have to go someplace else then I guess.We could go there, sure.Yes, yes.I have a new place.It– yep, recently.All right.Yeah, oh there you go.That’s good.We’re party girls.It’s okay. It’s all right.Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on–Here we go. This is gonna be good.Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car]Shhh… just calm down.[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh…Here’s the door. Here’s the door.[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let’s start meeting– Hello. How are you?I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.So do I sign?As it turns out you can’t just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um… I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.",
    "Angela": "It’s the nativity scene.I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.But–Really Andy? It’s Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.I don’t–Please stop making me do these things.But it’s the season of mercy.I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]It’s outside.Shut up.I’m not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you’re not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won’t be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.I think I’d like to go home now.",
    "Meredith": "[drinks] Oh… my… GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!![continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!I’m all right. I’m all right.A little better. I threw up.I’m not an alcoholic.I don’t care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.Sure.Obviously.You’re welcome.I am fine.I know I drink. I like to partyI am not an alcoholic!I don’t mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.We just missed Poor Richards.Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?The Bog? Cooper’s, Kelly’s……Brixx’s, Carmen’s……The Fort, Andy Gavin’s.Well, it must have just opened up.Yeah… all right.Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let’s get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!Yeah!Yeah that’s better.Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!No way!  There is no way! No way!No way!  No way!  There is no way!No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!I am not going in there! NO!!Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait![runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!This man is crazy! This man is crazy!No! No! No! No! No!NO!!!",
    "Pam": "I wish that you’d stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.I know.  If she wasn’t an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]I knew it.I knew some of it.It’s Christmas.Thank you. I knew it.",
    "Andy": "[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey… Ange… check it out.  [sings] There’s a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs][sings] There’s a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.Sorry.When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people’s empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B’s.  They called me Buzz.What’s up?Sure.All right, everybody’s still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I’ve been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",

    "Kevin": "Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.",
    "Toby": "Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith’s work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don’t know what your doing.Okay you know, this– this is over.Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow…[on phone] Hey Sasha, it’s daddy.
