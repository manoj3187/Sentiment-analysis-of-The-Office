    "Erin": "They’re back!Hi!Coco Leche! That’s my favorite!Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.[laughs] I think it will too, but I’ll just check with him, though.Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?Pam, we’re all set. [Pam places candy on Erin’s desk] Yum.Michael, you’re all set at Botticelli’s. I changed the reservation to two people.Fun!Hi Dwight!Night Michael.",
    "Kevin": "Oooh yeah… [people chuckle] Jim and Pam![to Angela] Shhhh…[to Angela] Shhh…Who’s pickle?Yes!  That’s what I’m talking about.[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh… where’d you get that hat?",
    "Kelly": "How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?[voice cracks] I’m so happy for you…[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?Well, I think I’d look really hot in one.  Where’d you get your fedora?I think I’m gonna get the same fedora as you.Well, I think I have that persona.What the hell is a mallard?Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.If you take it back, I’ll scream.[to Ryan] You’re so cool.",
    "Jim": "It was.Really was.Puerto Rico was awesome.[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.Nope.Do we have a conversation scheduled?Wow, that’s… really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.It’s a real handsome duck.Well, that’s great. Congratulations. Who’s the lucky lady?What?You’re messing with me.You did not have sex with Pam’s mom.What kind of car does she drive?[expletive]Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-Oh my God.Not now, Toby, my God!Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.No, not more than anything.Don’t call her “the mom.”Then take a different way home, man!Okay, so we’re good.Frank and beans!You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael’s slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]Uh, I think we should just drop it… ’cause obviously he doesn’t want to talk about it.Yes, you do.Just take the parrot.Okay, back to the old grind.Don’t-Sounds complicated.[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.Andy, can I talk to you for a second?[holding up a sign that reads, “Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office”]I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight’s birthday, what do you think?Really?I was gonna go with this one.And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]Yes!  Angela!  Please…Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder…Yes.Nothing… nothing at all… it’s all good!Barely, I… I don’t have all the facts.  Frank and Bean…[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey…Yep…[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.A wooden duck?Okay, just to be clear, you’re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage…Silence.I won’t.  But, you will wash and buff our car.[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?Well, we went on a Segway tour and we’re awesome at it and Frank and Beans!Yeah… maybe.You’re not, nope.  Nope.",
    "Pam": "It really was.Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.[goofy voice] Frank and beans!Hi, Michael.Some candy.That’s it.It’s good to be home.Hey!Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.Awesome! I’ll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.[laughs] I think it’ll be okay.Great.Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what’d we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?Come on, it’ll take two seconds.[giggles]Wow, Botticelli’s, that sounds like a special occasion.[laughs] I don’t know. I think Michael has a date.[laughs] I think you have a date.Come on.Oh, that’s too bad.Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.Of course.Oh.Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? …Who?No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo![screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window][outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He’s my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!Thank you.You need to be more upset about this. She’s your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.Haha!  Ha ha ha.I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]I love it, conservation.  Let’s start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]I’m not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.Don’t call my mother your lover.Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody’s mom…Uhh, huh, ho… oooh my God, you are ridiculous!You are never going to be my father, you get out!Me too…Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?Well, he could still… I’m sorry about that… Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.Sure, what’s up?[to Michael] What’s the matter, you can’t fight your own battles?[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?You can tell Michael that I’m not leaving.Michael, you’re just her rebound![to Jim] What!  You knew?Mmmmm, yes!Then why’d you even offer!?Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!What’s that supposed to mean?Shut it![looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?Mmmm.Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.Maybe I’m overreacting.But I don’t think I am.",
    "Michael": "Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?Is someone there? I can’t see you because I’m blind.[gasps] It is?They’re back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]And oh, Jim…Oh, I haven’t see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I’ve been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans][behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]I have recently taken a lover.Pam’s mom.Pam’s mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?About what?Oh, big time.She drives a green camry.And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.[laughs] What?Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?Get the hell out of here, idiot.I think you’re underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-She’s right on my way home from work.I di- alright, I’ll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.Yeah.Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?Sure. Thanks for asking.[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]Yeah.Yeah, no, it’s nobody.[chuckles] Hmm… no.I don’t.[sighs] I don’t deserve this, guys.No, I don’t.[long exhale]I was probably going to break up with her anyway.Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.It is.You want me to be happy?Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.More than a friend, a co-worker.It’s okay.That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.Okay.[sighs] Feels good.I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes, dinner.[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I’m not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people’s needs ahead of our own.Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.Alright, that’s…Alright…Okay, I’m out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys…Ok, oh no here’s an idea… conservation…Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo![on phone] What’s it… why are you crying?[on phone] No, no, no, I’ll talk to her.  I will… No… nobody talks to my baby that way… uh ah… yeah, I’ll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?Alright, in my defense…Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I’m outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  I’m caring, I’m generous, I’m sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.Let’s get back to the matter at hand.No, no, no… no, no…I don’t like the tone here… this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am…[walks into Toby’s office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was… uncalled for, I’m sorry.Can I sit down for a second?This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.Really?  Would you do that?[hugs Toby, who smiles big] You’re a good, good guy.No… that’s…I don’t… um… I can’t hear your conversation.Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay… you’re a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You’re just as stubborn as your mother, when you don’t wanna do something you just don’t do it.You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we’re gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.Well, that is not gonna happen!Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.You know what?  I’m gonna start dating her even harder.You know what it means.I don’t need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pam’s mom, my aunt… although she just blocked me on IM, what’s her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.[leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.Night Erin.",
    "Dwight": "Yeah!Its Jim and Pam, Michael.Yeah…This conversation has two items on the agenda.Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It’s not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don’t care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two… I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I’d just like to say… [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations![duck voice] You’re welcome! [quacks, laughs]I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.I’m sorry to have been bugging you all these years.Mallard. Okay, I’ll get out of your hair.[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?There’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down…There’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down……the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down… You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog… what was that all about?What were you talking about in there?Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.I don’t think there’s a whole lot of sleeping going on.[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!Where did you get that mallard?That!Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I’m taking that back.[sighs heavily] I’ll give you five bucks for it.Ten.Well, I had to, I mean… Kelly was not even…[walks into Jim’s office and takes out ear piece] I’m sorry.Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.Oh, I’m equipped… I can…Don’t tell Michael…Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim’s hand and leaves][walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim’s pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim’s voice] “We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our…” [pauses recording] I’ve got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I’m not insane. [starts the recording again] “…65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.”",
    "Meredith": "So what’d you bring us?What else?Oh, ’cause you spent so much on the wedding.Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.",
    "Toby": "[walks in] Hey, Jim.Oh, Jesus!What did I do?Yeah, sure, what’s up?Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.Yeah, er… pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.Yeah… that’s why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]I’m good…You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we’d become friends.[walks up to Pam’s desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that’s happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off… you know…[gets up and puts a hand on Michael’s shoulder] Buddy, I think that…",
    "Andy": "Sure thing, Tuna Boss.[in Jim’s office] How may I be of service to you?[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.What are you thinking?[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.I know, right?Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?That is not okay dude.",
    "Various": "Get out and stay out, bye…",
    "Angela": "I have some ideas about conservation…Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally…Well, for our profit…I’m sorry, I was told I had the floor.[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how’s your day going?",
    "Oscar": "Hold on, hold on, what’s going on?You have no sense of boundaries Michael.Maybe you’re right, who are we to…Hey.Pam, just for the record, I think you’re overreacting a little bit, your mom’s old enough to make her own decisions.My mother’s in a wheelchair.",
    "Phyllis": "Disgusting…Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you’re looking for.",
    "Creed": "She’s messed up man…",
    "Ryan": "Whoa, that’s my mother you’re talking about…Ahh, I don’t think so, no…I’d rather not say.[Ryan and Kelly talking] …it should go with the persona you already have.Twenty.Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.I’d rather not say.",
    "Stanley": "Heh, heh, heh."
