    "Erin": "Oh my God! I can’t believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money][whispering] Thanks. I still don’t understand why you wanted me to say that.Hi, guys. How you doing?Right. I’m sorry.Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?Sure.Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?Well, I like to swim.You have a cool place to come hang.Thanks.Wow.Now I do got it.Oh, yeah.That’s rule #1.Whew.It’s a cafe disco.Oh, my God! What happened?Yes.Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.You’re bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music – start dancing]Ashley! You made it!Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?Hey, Angela! Welcome to –",
    "Dwight": "Shut up.[laughs hysterically] I got her!I do.Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.[sighs] Now, how can I help you?Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court –It is a big deal. Cause there’s only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner’s permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.No.[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who’s Phillip?Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.What do you think history is?Out of the way! Move it or lose it!You want to get sick you go to the hospital.[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I’m gonna need two able bodied men.You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn’t doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It’s the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It’s like children singing Christmas carols.Tell me where it hurts.Oh yeah. you’ve got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.I’m gonna with the python.No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.What’s so funny?Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.You can’t steal what is legally your property.It is hard to imagine you playing softball.Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.I played high school softball. Notice I didn’t say “girls” high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you’re there say “Hi” to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he’s a cheat and a ball hog. And if he’s still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. ‘Cause she’s a heart breaking tart…and a ball hog.",
    "Pam": "Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]Oh, I can’t do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.Just sent it.If you don’t take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.Oh, no. Your battery fell out.So someone is going to a court. Big deal.We’re getting married today.Tell ’em how it happened.And very expensive.You can’t leave anyone out.Ok, just get to the good part.I had just woken up. I didn’t look cute. That’s how I knew he meant it.What?They’re beautiful.Yeah.This is so cheesy.I like cheesy.Yeah. I think maybe I want a “wedding” wedding.Really?",
    "Jim": "Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]There are other reasons to go to Ohio.So, it turns out it’s the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.Ok. So, we’re going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that’s great but then you have to invite –No one.Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ” You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.”That makes sense.[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.You ready?We should probably stop by. It’d mean a lot to him.We’re gonna stay.Yeah. At least for one more dance.Yes.Me, too.Me, too.Yeah.",
    "Michael": "[caught by camera crew dancing to “At the Car Wash”, but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate – it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.Guys, I’m scared. I’m really scared. I think I’m growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?Okay. How about a woman? Pam?Oh, really? Ok.What about the rest of you? [complete silence]At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don’t know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.Who else? Who else? Ryan?Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.What?Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work… is work.[still talking like a robot] I… was just learning… to… love.No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.That’s good.If you ever want to come down here, door’s always open, lock’s broken, so…Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.Now you got it.Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.Ok. I love it. I love it.I love it.Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There’s no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster’s People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don’t know. It’s like [pause] Dave died or something.Daddy’s here and daddy is going to take care of you.I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.Andy’s afwaid?Are you all afwaid?Daddy’s here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.Funk is the problem and the solution.I’ve taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.Why don’t you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.No. Dwight is confusing you. That – it’s, it’s more of a disco.… with coffee but without the haunted.It’s a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.Exactly.Wha – No. No. Not even close. I can’t force you to go down but I can entice you. I’m gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time… and all-you-can-eat espresso.Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.Holdin’ down the fort.Thank you.This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.Kevin, stay.Kevin, stay.Stay, stay.Cookie. Kevin, cookie.Mmm-hmm.Come on.Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you’re just some terrible monster.Phyllis?Hey![starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!Oh, wow! What did you do?You didn’t do that. You’re ok. You’re ok. Let’s lie down. You want to go down? Alright.Ok. That’s ok. That’s not a problem. Ok, sweetie.No. No. No.It’s her back. We just – We need – Let’s – You know what?We’re going to take care of you. We’re gonna get you help. Let’s – come on.Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.I don’t need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?It’s just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.You having fun?What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we’re going to put you in here. Dwight’s going to take care of you.Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.Oh, you know. Nohting. She’s  – we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she’s a tough, old bird. So…Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don’t think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.I don’t care. Bury it. I hope you’re happy.I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.It’s better than I imagined it!Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?Oh. Alright. There you go.No. No. No. Here is the deal – one signature for every song.I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ” This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We’re not going to eat you.” [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.Hey, thank you, Creed. you’re really getting this place.Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!No… cleaning… up.Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It’s really happening.You guys are the best for coming. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to. I understand.Really?Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It’s not even to “Y”.Would you like to dance?My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would….fall down. But then…he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He…stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don’t want that to happen to you guys. I’m not gonna let it happen.",
    "Ryan": "I don’t do lunch. I’m eating five small meals a day now.Now that I’m back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.",
    "Angela": "No. I don’t want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.Come.Kevin, come.Kevin, come.Come on, right now.Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.Wha –Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There’s no cookie. There’s no cookie. Come on. Come.Completely unacceptable.Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?Stop!No. I didn’t come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.No. You need to sign them all.Look, I hate to be “that” person but I just don’t like the general spirit of music.You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]",
    "Phyllis": "Michael, we have a lot of work to do.Work.It’s a combo dance house coffee bar.Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?Oh, I’ll just duck my head in.Tell him I’m going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.Mmm-hmm.Hi.Hey. I like.Oh! Mother ******!Back![moans in pain]Wow! Sorry!It’s my back.Call a doctor.No. Call Bob.What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.Dwight! Dwight!I do.That feels good, Dwight.An hour? I can’t stay here an hour.But the rattler’s so scary.I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]When I say it out loud it’s so silly. [they both laugh]Wanna dance, Dwight?I was all-county my junior and senior years.The girls school?",
    "Oscar": "Please don’t refer to yourself as our daddy.Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?What happened to Phyllis?You invited someone?I’ve been here 8 years and I’ve never… [Erin walks away] Rude.Just go down, Kevin.",
    "Andy": "[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.Yes.It’s like a haunted disco.[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent – blaring “[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now”, spins in chair] Oww!Yeah! I love the vibe down here.I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’m in a dance off. Alright!This dance competition is not over.Yeah. No. Well, ok.Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.I, I – but you’re not a professional and I’m thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.Are you sure that’s not the “gay” ear?Well, I…Count to twen – count to twenty.KAgh! Son of a bitch!It was?",
    "Meredith": "This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?",
    "Kevin": "So, like, a disco cafe?Yeah.Yeah. This place is great.I’m sorry.Yeah. Respect the lei.[to Michael] Is there a cookie?I wanted a cookie.Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?Oh…cause you smell like bacon.Tight. I’m going down the hall to this office to see Michael – there’s free espressos.I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.Are you sure that you didn’t eat bacon?Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.I love the smell of bacon on a woman.Hey, Lynn, it’s Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.",
    "Jessica": "Oh, he’s on a call.It’s pretty important. He wouldn’t want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?I’ll let him know.",
    "Stanley": "I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.How did I end up back in Crazytown?",
    "Kelly": "Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.What dance competition? I was just dancin’ casual with my friends, y’all.Stop squirming.You wanted to do this. Just be brave.I’m doing it. No. I’m doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I’m gonna mess up.Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?Look, I’m gonna count to 3.No. I’m gonna count to 3.1… 2… 3Andy, that was just the ice.Yeah. It was.",
