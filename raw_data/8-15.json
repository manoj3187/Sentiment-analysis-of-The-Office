    "Dwight": "Today is the first day of Sabre’s new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy… We’re already twenty minutes late.Wake up! [Cathy screams]Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?Stanley! Wake up! Youâ€™ve got to wake up, the hotel’s on fire![lets go] Good morning.Heeeere’s Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees “IT WAS DWIGHT” written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn’t me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I’ve loved working with Pam and she’s frankly wonderful, but I hate her.I’ll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn’t acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.Power.Okay, Twiggy, that’s enough. Get in the car.I’m fine, okay? It’s just stress. You know, ’cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.Very funny, Jim.I’m gonna set your face on fire.Packer.Uh. [eats antacids]You didn’t poison me, it’s just stress.What is the antidote?I’ll do it! I always say, “You want something done right? Ask Dwight.” Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you’ll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it’s tender. It can’t be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don’t know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?Yeah, I’m gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There’s no name listed.Send it to the frickin’ moon, idiot.You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I’m a master hunter.I’m a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that’s a master baiter.Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let’s get back to work! Break’s over!I’ll be on top. It’s the most important position.[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I’m gonna vomit![groans] Stop moving!Oh! [collapses]Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.Don’t remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.[to phone] Phillip, if you’re hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I’m dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it’s Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.I just got out of surgery. What’s going on? Fill me in.Who’s doing the presentations?Damn it!Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.I’m great. How are you?What’s our presentation about?I got the surgery, what else is there to do?No, I don’t feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.I want that vice-presidency.“You’re too slow, you’re too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.” You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I’m going to do it.All right, who’s ready for the next presentation?What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is… [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?No, sit down. “Seasonal.” Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman’s only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna… take a… brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.Anderson’s three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?Ingredients.Burgers.Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson’s three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight’s pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I’m not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?Oops. That’s embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.[show her the wound] Oh God.You’re not paying me to heal, you’re paying me to kick ass.That’s right.Ah! Not so fast.I’ll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.",
    "Erin": "Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.Stanley, wake up, it’s pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley’s nose and covers his mouth]Hey, wake up. Let’s have some fun. We’re in Florida now.What do you think happened?Hey, are you okay?Who says none of us are diarrheal?Yeah!Jim, are you in?How long will he be gone?Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.Packer’s giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim’ll probably give ours, I guess.Let’s see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it’s like if you wear yours on your shirt, you’re a total dip, but if you switch, you’re a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-Do a hundred jumping jacks.I don’t feel like it either![doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-Retail consumer habits.[whispers] Convenience.Service.Building loyalty.Famous, hi. I’m sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-I’m sorry to have wasted your time.",
    "Stanley": "Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!Laugh it up, Halpert. I’m in Florida for a month without my family. I’m gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.You’re a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.Did I say “Messina?” [tires screech]Get the damn phone.Life is short. “Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.” That’s one of my mottoes.It’s just rum. I’m not bored, I’m a pirate.It’s whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle]Or do you only drink with your kids?Sounds like a hoot. I’m in.Aw, let him do it.Yup.What’s under the cloth?",
    "Ryan": "Hey, you. I’m so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water’s fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!Okay, and this one is, “Huh. Don’t see too many museums around here.”So who’s leading this thing, anyway?I can’t wait to meet him.I-Dude, I think you have appendicitis.Dwight?Oh! Who called it? Nothin’ but net.I can field this one.",
    "Jim": "I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I’m up and at ’em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn’t know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]Puppet.Yeah. It’s weird being away from them. Never done this before.Are you sure it’s stress? Because I did poison you.Oh no, I’m serious. I was thinking, “For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?” and then I thought of it. I’ll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?That’s a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?Yes.Loggins and Messina.Man.Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.I would love to hear the other mottos.No way.It was-You got to stop with the antacids. It’s not the antidote.Okay.True love’s kiss.Dwight, I didn’t poison you. I was kidding.Wow. Are you that bored?Is that another motto?Mmm.Ah, let’s do it. [laughs] Oh, that’s healthy.I’ve spent so much of my life telling myself “Please, don’t end up like Stanley,” and now I’m wondering if I even have what it takes.Oh, I don’t know.All right, what the heck? Let’s do it.Dwight, why don’t we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?No one’s moving!Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida’s pretty loose with the death penalty.Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.You haven’t done any of the research.Stanley, are you listening to music?You are bleeding through your shirt.",
    "Cathy": "Cool, for your kids?How was the drive?Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.Well that was just one idea. It doesn’t have to be winter.",
    "Saleswoman": "What does he like?",
    "Andy": "Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn’t resist. It’s so quiet.It’s so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin… [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.Oh! There we go! Pam?Can you get the phone?Mm, well, you used to be.Phone’s ringing.Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you’ve reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?Yeah, I figured we’d keep things savory while Oscar’s mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.Up high.Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.I’m acting like I like reception and I’m a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there’s the phone!Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail ’cause it’s your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen… yogurt.Yes I am, as a matter of fact.I found my calling.[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup]I mean… [Pam giggles][answers the reception phone] Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.Oh, she’s on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.I miss her too.",
    "Creed": "I like it. It’s so peaceful, I’ve already written like, twelve plays today.Ah, Dwell.",
    "Darryl": "I loved it.Oh [bleep] yeah.Yes sir. Thanks.Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn’t real, ’cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won’t want to do her. She’s a dog.",
    "Meredith": "Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.You’re the closest one to it.",
    "Oscar": "Can we see that? Did you really find it?",
    "Pam": "Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn’t the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.There. [phone rings]Yeah?Well I’m not the receptionist.I know, but I can’t cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.Whoa, are those mini pizzas?Hey, having fun?Well I know how it is. I know it’s a lot of fun. I don’t know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?Guys, I don’t like this analogy.It’s nice.",
    "Everyone": "Oh great. [overlapping chatter]Somebody! Answer the phone.Oh, oh! [general commotion]",
    "Kelly": "We’re screwed.Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it’s for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!Andy, pick up the phone!",
    "Packer": "Quick query, Halpert.Still queer?You can’t put me down. Too strong!Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat’s got nine lives, and a nine-inch-I can do it.I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I’ve really gotten back into hunting big time.Totally. I mean, I’d never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting’s intense.Did you say “masturbator?”Yup. Tallahassee, let’s go.This is great. This is gonna be great.Dude, don’t you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.Drama queen, am I right?That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]It would be an honor, ma’am.Cookies. Bet you anything itâ€™s cookies.",
    "Nellie": "Psst. Say, “So who’s leading this thing, anyway?”Psst. Say, “I can’t wait to meet him.”Him, you say? Don’t think a woman can be a leader?You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I’m not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I’m Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we’re going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn’t “a good fit-”Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, “Yes!” So let’s talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.Let me just get the projector working.Jim, help me lower this screen. You’re a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You’d be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.Is there not? Maybe I’m just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]Hunting’s so primal. Almost sexual.Why are you sitting down like that?We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We’ve got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans… pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It’s a team-building exercise. You’ll love it. Who’s in? Hmm?I feel like I’m in ancient Egypt.Very good point.Dwight, are you all right?Ah, what is your topic?What are the three pillars of retail?Very true. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant’s brother, John Grant. He’s older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.How are you feeling?Can I see the wound?Oh! That’s disgusting. That’s barely healed.A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.That is amazing. Todd, look at that.Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]Ah, we get the gist. It’s just success and effort, isn’t it? So just, don’t be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]",
    "Emergency Operator": "Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?",
    "Paramedic": "You need an operation. You have appendicitis.Two or three days.",
    "Kevin": "Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I’m huge.Are those the lyrics?",
    "Donna Muraski": "Hi Andrew. What happened to Erin?Oh, good for her. She’s such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her.",
    "Wally Amos": "Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you’re all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos-We’ll get to that.It’s cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first.Is it oatmeal with no raisins?"
