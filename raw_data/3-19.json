    "Andy": "Good morning, Pam.Drew.  I’m Drew now.Apology not… accepted.  Because it wasn’t even necessary in the first place. [laughs]Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I’m back.  And I’ve got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And… a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.Mornin’ Jim.Good.  Drew.Dr— You can call me Drew.Cool.  I can’t control what you do.  I can only control whatdo.Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How’s it goin’ man?You guys…It’s on!Thank you.Anything.You mean a moon bounce.I’m gonna need… I’m gonna need petty cash.Do you, do you want a drawbridge?Whoa!  What’s the situation?Ok, when’s the shunning thing gonna end?When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I’m so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin’ guys.Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do… Then you might lose your mind.Ahhh… Is that the last of it?It’s OK. I can’t always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.Is it fresh? [winks]Umm… [draws back arm] No. [laughs]People don’t need to be afraid of me. I can’t achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn’t care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen “An Inconvenient Truth”. Nearly twice.[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and… acting on that thing.Yes bosses.[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we’re listening.Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don’t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don’t jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.Up to you.If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it![in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]",
    "Pam": "Oh, welcome back, Andy.Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.It’s called being smart.I don’t know how the whole betting thing started, but it’s fun.Ten…47, 48, 49! Jim wins!I don’t understand the question.Yeah…It’s really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.So, you’re okay?Hey Creed.Hey.Yes!What are the odds that this is in any way real?Oh… God.  Oh my God, he’s gonna jump.Yeah…Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.Come down and… open it and you’ll see.Dwight, what are you—I thought I’d stay and answer the phones.Hey!",
    "Jim": "Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?What’s that?No, I’m not gonna call you that.Andy.Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.Dwight says that he actually doesn’t know one single fact about bear attacks.[half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that’s too far.You really wanna bet?Ok, you’re on.No, don’t worry about it.  We’ll just got double or nothin’.I don’t know, we’ll figure somethin’ out.There’s like ten green ones.I’m gonna say fifty.Oh, don’t be that person.Kev’s out.Okay, okay.Okay.I’d say like… 10,000 to 1?Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.Oh, excuse me.  It’s my… favorite part.Oh my God, therea castle.Oh.  He’s going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.Hey uh, Michael.  Don’t jump on the bouncy castle.  You can’t do that, because you’re going to get horribly, horribly injured.Dwight…Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.Come on.Come on. He’ll listen to you.Oh!No no no!OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]",
    "Dwight": "Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I’m looking forward to.  It’s an Amish technique.  It’s like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday… for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.Ok, tell him that’s not true.Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!Damn you.Yeah!Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?Wolves.Visual aids.A quilt.  Depression quilt?[on the roof] Okay, let’s do this thing!  I’ll go summon the troops!We measured it once…Seedless?Ready?[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]Okay.Got it.We’re not allowed to use the baler.I’m on it!I’m temporarily lifting the shun.It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.What do you think?  You’ve got an hour.Shunning resumed.Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!That’s right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It’s rock n’ roll!Yeah![imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near![singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin’ off the roof![singing] Bouncin’ on the bouncy bounce!  Show ’em who’s boss![singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun![out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange![hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he’s suffering from depression. Re-shun.Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!It’s gorgeous.  Let’s go!No really, it’s, it’s very nice.  Come on!Everybody’s gonna be fine in exactly what they’re wearing, let’s go!  Let’s go![outside] Come on, hurry up you guys![on megaphone] Michael, what’s wrong?!Depression?  Isn’t that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?Is that the last year the data was available?Don’t do anything rash!I didn’t… [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn’t think you needed them for this part.you said to just…Okay, I’m on it!Attention blue collar workers!Michael’s up on the roof and he’s acting strange!Michael!  What’s wrong?Depressed?  Isn’t that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?No, there’s nothing to see over there, people!  There’s nothing to see.  …They found the castle, Michael.Okay, uh… I don’t see anything.  She might be bluffing.Oh… It’s uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they’re only available in Japan.Come on.Step lively. Single file everybody.Let’s single…Single… OK.Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.[sighs]No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?Right.Argh!Ghaaa!Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready… Go! One Mississ… OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ… correct… ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi… e. Right here.OK, if he’s not down by four, I’ll get the papers up to him.Come on pretty boy.It’s only leased, and it’s got rust damage, he’ll never get his deposit back.",
    "Michael": "Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl’s presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.Hmm.I can, and I have.Guys, I’m not the only one who’s driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.I thought your name was Pudge?Okay.  Um, her.Ah, fine.Yeeesh.[barely keeping his composure] “Hey Darryl, how’s it hangin’?!” [laughs]Bail’er?  I hardly know her.Yes, yes.  But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world… if somebody…It’s a big red trash compactor!Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  …  Only on the rarest of occasions……would I go near—Toby now has the floor…  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and…Wow, that is… that time really adds up.  That’s like… a half an hour, every hour?Ok, you know what?  You’re making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let’s see.  “Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.”Ok guys, you know what?  I didn’t— I didn’t interrupt when you were having your presentation.Yes.  Okay, let’s do another one.  This is a good one.  “A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute—“Yes.  “Which can contribute to heart disease.”  Heart disease kills more people that balers.Mmmm, no, no, it’s… sedentary…No.Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I—Okay.  … What, Nerf isn’t cool anymore?Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men’s Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I’d like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make ’em feel like wimps.  Not me, I…  “Hello, I’m Michael.  Welcome to Men’s Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.” … This is one example.Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.I— I—  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin’ fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that…Yeah… you are… ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight… and you know science.Indubitably.They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.I don’t know, I don’t know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression—Nn— Depression.Yes.You may be asking yourself, “What am I doing on a trampoline?”  Well, I thought I’d bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here’s the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we’re going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where’s Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I… tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, “Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?”  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see… the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note:They might think “Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.”  But that’s… not why I’m doing this… Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner… Ta-freakin’-da!  [Dwight nods]Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or…Go buy some watermelons.Just…Let’s do it!  Drop that sucker.BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh… crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.Find out whose car that is.  If it’s Stanley’s, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.Have Pa–adge do it, or… the sea monster.Yes, thank you for seeing that.I don’t know if I wanna do this.No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we’re not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.Rock n’ roll!That’s right!  I am not thinking.Yes!  Yeah!Woo!Woo!I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar][on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life…Everything’s wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!Wait, where are the warehouse guys?Okay… that’s…That’s the whole point, dummy.Okay.Oooooh, my life!Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.Dwight, you ignorant slut.And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!Damn it.What is it?Dwight, find out what the present is.Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?You told me, that I lead a… cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.What do I have to live for?It’s complicated with Jan.  And I don’t know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn’t nearly as good as it used to be.Do you really mean that?I’m braver than you?I Braveheart.  I am.Okay.  Pam, I’m coming down to get my present.An office… is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That’s the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can’t say.  But, yes.OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let’s go.Don’t worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life… Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.Here we go.Field Trip.Like we’re going to the science museum.Learn by touching.I’ve been told that I’m a tactile learner.Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you…I…Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.We got beat today, Dwight.But it was not a fair fight.It was the warehouse guys…… Dwight, they embarrassed us…… because they had a much scarier safety presentation.You know what’s funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what’s not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five… Now that’s funny.How do you make depression sexy? How do you… How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon… the conun… the conumberyThose warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I’m going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]Yeah, Drew.You know Drew, why don’t you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.I’m going to wait. I don’t want to say this twice, it’s too painful and I’m too depressed.I will miss you the most Ryan.Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today… And you don’t worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat… And there are no roofs in coal mines.",
    "Darryl": "Now, this is the forklift.  You need— [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workersdrive it. … Quiz!  Mike.Should you drive the forklift?No! No no no no no!  I saidyou.  You should not drive it.  You should not drive the forklift, you understand?It’s not safe, you don’t have a license.Her.  Yes, “her” is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?Do you understand that?We do safety training every year, or after an accident. … We’ve never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled…And I fell and busted my ankle.  I’m legitimately scared for my workers.The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?Anybody?Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful…These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,, should not go anywhere near them.It’s not a trash compactor!  It’s a baler!No do not touch it!There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?Take them at the same time.Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.Actually, you did.Alright, we outta here.That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, Mike.  It’s serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin’ on your biscuit.  Never havin’ to risk it.Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you’re gonna serious hurt yourself.Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.A lot… of things.  Uh, you, uh… What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It’s goin’ good, right?Mike, you’re a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just toyou.  To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.I couldn’t do it. I— I ain’t that strong.  And I ain’t that brave.braver!  You Braveheart, man.Come down, okay?Summing up.You own a convertible. Come on man that’s, that’s hot. Women love that stuff right?",
    "Lonny": "You’re not allowed to drive the forklift.Dammit, Michael.  Pay attention, man.What theis wrong with this man?What are you—Don’t disrespect the baler!Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain’t it?That’s called having a fat butt, Michael.Yeah, yeah.  That’s, that’s fat butt disease.  That’s what you suffer from?Fat butt disease, Michael?Yeah?  I bet you’d like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn’t you?Dude, tell your girl to shut up.Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.",
    "Madge": "Madge.No, it’s always been Madge.",

    "Guy": "How many?",
    "Oscar": "What are you guys talkin’ about?Really, ten?  That’s your guess?  You’re a professional accountant.Forty-two.",
    "Darry": "It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.",
    "Toby": "Ok, um, one thing that you’re gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It’s recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you’re gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.Um, yeah.  You’re computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it’s also recommended that you step away for about… about ten minutes every hour.No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.Well, that’ll work.You know, anything that warms you.Sedentary.[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.Nice.",
    "Ryan": "What about a long sleeve T?Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.I guess I forgot.

Seriously I don’t get it.",
    "Kelly": "Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.Ryan?What?!Are you kidding me?So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let’s just say that I just sent back, which was awesome.  [Karen lays money down on the desk next to Ryan] And they sent me, which is also awesome.  But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it’s at the bottom of the que!  Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this.  I go online, I go click, click, click.  And I change the order of the que, so that I can see[Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to.  It’s so easy, Ryan.  Do you really not know how Netflix works? [Jim throws his money down]You’re such a ditz.Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.Screw you.Give me that thing, I want to try.I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt.
