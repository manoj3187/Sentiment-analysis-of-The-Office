    "Oscar": "[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I’m in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]…Why?Kevin, listen to me. I’m in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?Can you do this, Kevin?I don’t know what that means. Hey, hey-Perfect.Kevin!That actually wasn’t the worst cover. I’d say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.That’s a tough one.I’m in big trouble.[looking at folder he brought Toby]It’s clearly not an accounting mistake.So…Well, you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do.I hope that’s it, Kevin.Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..Oh, you’re right I’m so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]Those figures I gave you? They’re false.I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.Yes, he’s innocent.What are you talking about? I just did this now.Sure.That’s gotta be tough.Well, I am sorry Kevin.No.You know what? I’m sorry. I overreacted. Because I’m stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who’s not stressed out?

    "Andy": "Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?White, I’m not a day trader, I’m just a first responder in a disaster.Are the ‘Nard’s hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I’m kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that’s cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.Yeah. He’s in rehab actually.No, it’s in New Mexico.We’re done Meredith.Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn’t steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So…what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]Alright, what’s the grand total? Did we make our nut?Guys, you don’t understand, this boat’s been in our family since before I was born.Alright, uh…alright. I’m gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don’t need the boat. Can’t cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.Uh, did you need something?Ok. [signs paper] thanks.Look, it’s not that I don’t want-All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn’t let me. Said “You can’t be a skipper until you’re a man.” You know, I’d reach for the wheel and he’d smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I’m the man of the family and… we’re selling the damn thing. So I’m never gonna have the chance.Tonight.Yeah right. It’s in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.Yeah, ok.Seriously?Alright.Let’s do it.That’s the family boat!Right?Sorry?Sure, I um..I didn’t know.Ok.Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.Really?[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!Oh, it’s OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.You got it. You know what then, we’ll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.Ok, fine.Yeah, fine.Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy’s hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.I’ve had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.Fine. But I could have.I am the captain.Right?I’m the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.I’m taking it over from here.Yeah, I know cause I’m sailing it there.Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to…I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  [Opens door, Andy’s brother is passed out inside] Walt?I thought you were in rehab.I didn’t.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I’ve decided to sail it to Bermuda.Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You’re the best ever![pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World’s Greatest. You did this! Dammit I’m happy![waving from boat] I’ll see you in three weeks!No way!Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them’s my chords!",

    "Pam": "Andy’s family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he’s been handling it is just..so..Right?[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I’ll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?Nope, that’s Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand][On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview’s off. They’re opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so…He’s gonna be disappointed.[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it’s a pleasure.No the paper’s not toxic.Unless it’s exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!",

[Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!I have to go to the bathroom!

[laughing]Yeah, Oscar’s in big trouble.[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I’m getting a promotion?Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn’t screw up your secret with Angela. I’ve been really worried about that.Hi.Oscar, we’re in the middle of talking.Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]What are you doing?Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.

Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.” It’s that easy.[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle…[Group protests]…In a bitter battle..Hey, hey!

I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says “Now Pants”] Your voice, it’s sounding a little feminine.Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?I’m getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc…Sandra Mick [points to Pam]Let’s get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?Are you insulting my guests?The fallout from this morning’s revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company’s stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage.

I put an innocent man on death row.",

Can’t do that.We’ve already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us.I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you’re not supposed to touch.OK.Good stuff.What?I hate to uh, ruin this moment…or breakdown, but you already signed the papers.
