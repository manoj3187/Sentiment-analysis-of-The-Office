    "Pam": "[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we’ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.There’s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it’s not — it doesn’t sound cool. You just have to see it.Well, I guess it doesn’t look that cool either. But, it’s been up there a long time, so it’s become a pretty big deal.Did a good job, Buddy. Now it’s time to come home.What?You messed up saying your name?Robert, is Nellie our new manager?How can you give us performance reviews if you don’t know us?No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.I like working here.Phyllis.Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager’s position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I’m easy.Whoa, that’s kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn’t is because I’m breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn’t like a bottle.No.I think… you’re a witch.[drowsily] I’m amazing. [sighs]",
    "Kevin": "Nice.When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, “Look, a balloon.”ooohHuh. Yeah, that’s weird. He’s usually here by now. Right guys?Hot tub party?I do. [applause] Come on everyone…Come on Jim, you’re killing her!",
    "Jim": "Wow. It’s the end of an era.And I was still just a paper salesman.Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?NellieWhat brings you to town?No, that’s Andy’s office.Can’t you do something about this?-Right.What is going on? And where’s Andy? And what is going on?I think it’s a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It’s not a name.Any luck?[on phone] Andy?Andy, where are you?What? You’re in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram’s trying to take your job.Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you’re basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.Dwight, should she be our manager?And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]The raise isn’t real.Um… are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.Land. World. Uh, it’s not that I don’t want a– well, yes, I guess I’d take a raise. That’s not what I’m saying. That’s not– sorry.Yes.Oh, god, nature, please.[exhales sharply]Was that not the–Mm-hm.Was that it? No, that wasn’t bad.No. I would’ve said no.I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it’s okay for someone to just take someone else’s job? Shouldn’t work like that.No, it’s not, because you don’t really work here.Yeah, that’s the thing. I don’t know if you can even give raises.Yes.No.She dies.Let’s see it. Show of hands.All right, guys, stop.How?",
    "Oscar": "I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.",
    "Ryan": "How long do you think it’s been up there, Kevin?",
    "Dwight": "My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]Right here.What?How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I’m in an identical situation.I wouldn’t let her manage a celery farm.Those who can’t farm, farm celery.I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.What?There’s no limit to what I think I deserve.Five percent. No less.Six percent, I know my worth.Money isn’t real ever since we got off the gold standard.No, you know what? Nellie’s right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I’m here. This is mine. Back off.[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.",
    "Meredith": "My kid didn’t have a face tattoo.I already spent the money.",
    "Darryl": "I was still thinking of going back to school.Me.No.No.No.No.No.",
    "All": "Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause]We believe! We believe!",
    "Phyllis": "Yeah.Nellie, I’m sorry, but I don’t feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don’t know.Pam.Really?",
    "Nellie": "Allow me to solve your problem, then.Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let’s build a shrine. No, I’ve come to work here.Mm.That one looks empty.Oh, is it?I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It’s how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.Robert.So far, so good.Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.Mm-hm.Oh, I’ve already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I’ve been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn’t it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It’s a lot. So, who knows what’s going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it… chumbo?So no one can tell me what’s going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m’lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.Performance reviews.On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.All right. Let’s get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You’re getting a raise.Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?Then you accept it?Absolutely not. Seven percent.So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I’m fairly certain you’re going to like it.So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there… all very impressive.Mm, let’s see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.So, Pamela, I’m going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.That’s not really what you want. What you want is a good night’s sleep, working mother of two.Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for– what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There’s a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I’ll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.I think you’re amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: “I’m amazing.”Jim, time for your review.Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn’t you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?I’m Tinkerbell.Mm-hm. I’m a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.But here’s the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn’t exist.She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don’t work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that’s the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It’s just random.",
    "Toby": "Robert did say you’d be joining us. Welcome. I’m Tony.I- I said I’m Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I’m Toby.It happens, okay? Uh, so let’s just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I’m sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.",
    "Erin": "Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.How are you? How’s your family doing?Bye.Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That’s right. I’m a maid for an old lady. Her grandson’s staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.I’m in the bathroom.Yes.Andy, what are you doing here? It’s great to see you.Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.Um, Andy… I am so happy to see you. But I’m not coming back with you.Hey… don’t listen.Oh, thanks. I’ve been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It’s only going to keep getting better.So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.You didn’t even stop to pee? Gross.Oh, you’re doing so good. Oh my God, you’re superman over there. [Andy’s phone vibrating]I’ve heard that’s amazing when it works.Andy, I care about you and I think–No, go ahead.Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we’re not meant to be.I know.Really? ’cause you’ve been kind of a B to him all afternoon.Irene, what would you do without me?Why?Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don’t go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don’t love you. I’m sorry.Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]Let’s get out of here.Let’s go.No, I don’t have any stuff.I don’t have one.No.I just… there’s always one around.I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?",
    "Alonzo": "Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers]",
    "Robert": "Nellie.How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?Good.Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn’t it?Now. Let’s find you something fun to do here, shall we?We have a manager.Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?Andy, it’s Robert. Why aren’t you at work?I don’t care, I don’t care. Please come to work immediately.He just hung up on me mid-sentence.Not much we can do about this until he gets here.Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it’s very interesting how it’s playing out.We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone’s lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?I am not. Huh.Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?When two animals are having sex, one of them…… is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua– this isn’t very helpful. You’re gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.All life is sex. And all sex is competition.And there are no rules to that game. That wasn’t so perverted, now was it?My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn’t he decide who the manager is?Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie’s leadership. I believe. [applause continues]",
    "Andy": "[on phone] Hello.Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I’m super sick.Okay, I’ll try to come in even though I’m really sick with the…[standing in ocean] …Florida Flu.I’m in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn’t coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I’m yours!Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.Hm?Well, we’re not really dating anymore, so… basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I’s, you know.All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn’t want to stop until I saw you.[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-Nope. It’s just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I’m getting stronger.I don’t know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It’s fine.I don’t think it does that.Jim?I- I’m home in bed. I’ve been in bed all day. I got the– I got the serious poops, man.What do you mean, take my job?Okay… Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I’m not coming home without Erin. So I’ll talk to you later.Yeah, if I had my own––sorry, you go.Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other’s mouth. It’s just stupid. What were you going to say?You broke my heart too.I’m so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.[sighs]That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin’s favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It’s biodegradable. Animals will eat it.Erin!Okay.Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.Like your toothbrush and stuff.You don’t have a toothbrush?How do you not have a toothbrush?You just use whichever one is sitting there?Of course. I own my toothbrush.",
    "Irene": "Erin, you got a package.Did you wash your hands?Where’s the ring?Where’s the ring, Lancelot?[whispering] I don’t know. Maybe it’s ’cause he’s not that handsome.So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?I think you should leave, young man.You should take it. It’s probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.You really wouldn’t feel those kinds of results after one session.You could put it on silent.Just go to preferences, then click –He’s here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.Erin, I think you’re making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he’s willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink–We’re not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn’s going to sue Home Depot.He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.",
    "Glenn": "Where’s the postage? I mean, there’s no shipping label.[whispering off screen] Why won’t she go with him?Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.[answering Andy’s phone] Proctology.",
    "Erin and Irene": "[screaming as Andy busts out of box]",
    "Angela": "Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn’t have to work?",
    "Kelly": "Oh, great.",
    "Creed": "Touch me and I’ll sue.",
    "Stanley": "And we are grateful."
