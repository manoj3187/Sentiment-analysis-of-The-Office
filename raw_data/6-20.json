    "": "[Andy, Angela, Phyllis, Ryan, Kelly, and Oscar are gathered around Oscar’s computer lauging at a video of Cookie Monster]",
    "Cookie Monster": "[Kevin’s voice] Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I’m sitting on them. [all laugh][Kevin’s voice] What’s the difference between a chimichanga, [Kevin arrives behind the group] a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It’s urgent.[Kevin’s voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin.",
    "Andy": "This is awesome!It’s Secretary’s Day. And it is Erin’s and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant “Happy Secretary’s Day” banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin’s chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it’s Secretary’s Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.I do.If it wasn’t for secretaries, I wouldn’t have a stepmom.[arrives at Michael’s office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary’s Day.Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there’s only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary’s Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear’s arm at Michael].[slams his hand on Michael’s desk] That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.[taping desk] She’s gonna be so psyched.So… how was lunch?Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?Well, I know. [stammers] Just want… I mean… [chuckles]Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.Specific shout-out..Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary’s Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend… in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It’s a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..Can we talk about this in private?Yes.Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary’s Day?I was going to tell her, just on my own time.Who cares? I mean it’s not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it… I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.Will you stop walking for one second? That’s it. There’s no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.A year.Yeah but that’s it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else…I didn’t see that movie.Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary’s Day.",
    "Oscar": "Thank you. It didn’t even take that long.Thank you.Yes.Erin? I think we’re out of fax cover sheets.Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.Why didn’t you do Oscar the Grouch?",
    "Kevin": "This isn’t funny. I don’t talk like that. [all continue laughing]No. I won’t say it.Angela, this is inappropriate.Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I’m not falling for that.Man, Darryl, I’m sorry. [pats Darryl’s back] Happy Birthday.They’re making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they’re making fun of me.[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M’s? The level…Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.I’m not crying.[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]Yeah.Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would’ve told you.So if you need anything, I’m right over there.“C” is for suspension.[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I’m now going to apologize for the mess that we’re in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.“Ciao” Right? “Ciao. I say Ciao because I’m fancy from Tallahassee.”I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It’s awesome.But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.Thank you.WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 1.8.9",
    "Phyllis": "Say “Me eat cookie.”Mm-hmm.I don’t get it.",
    "Dwight": "Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar’s desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?I love that show.That is an amusing link. I’d like it sent to me, please.[hands Erin a basket of beets]Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.Her milk is coming in. She’s getting uncomfortable.Same thing happens with my cows if I don’t tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they’ll moo like crazy.[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.Yeah pretty much.Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it’s done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?“I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.”",
    "Ryan": "It’s Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.Good work, buddy.C.C. meThat’s a little derivative.Uh, it’s not organic. Do you know what I mean?",
    "Kelly": "Me, too Oscar.[using a Cookie Monster voice] “My name is Kevin, I’m an accountant.” See I did the voice.But parody is always derivative.Do they still get paid?But you’re an accountant too.",
    "Angela": "This is my favorite day.Psst. Hey. Erin.You embarrassed me earlier.You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It’s the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!",
    "Meredith": "Here you go.[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.I just like the way it feels.Just relax. Okay.This is like the Cadillac of pumps.Okay, I was just warming it up.It’s not a big deal.We’re both girls. Who cares?Pathetic.",
    "Erin": "Oh, thank you.Thank you.[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.Well, happy Boss’s day. There wouldn’t be a secretary if there was no boss.I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth’s.Just the two of us.Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth’s, but…Oh.[cheerfully] Okay.I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?I would have chosen the 1490’s.‘Cause America was discovered.[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don’t know, I couldn’t keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it’s like… I don’t mean that I didn’t like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn’t have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.How many pillows do you sleep on at night?He’s the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.Yeah I love that.What?Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?Why wouldn’t he tell me that?They had sex?Uhhhh, they were engaged?[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh…[moans, pulls hair over her face]In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming][breathes heavily, groans]Lunch was fine.I don’t know. It was lunch, Andy.God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It’s easy.[throws a piece of cake at Andy’s face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.I don’t want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn’t know?Who are you?! I don’t know you! [pushes someone away to leave]Thanks.You want to talk to me, come to my desk.Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.I want to throw up just thinking about it.Really?It was Andy, wasn’t it?I hope you find what you’re looking for.Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What’s your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?How long were you guys together?A year? You were together for a year?I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?[sitting on bench outside groaning]Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.I can’t trust Andy anymore.It’s Andy’s fault.Oh, I like his butt.You tricked me!",
    "Pam": "Hey, thanks.It’s my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?… It rocked. It rocked my ass off.[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn’t have watered it?It’s nice to see you again, Dwight.[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.No, no, he’s right.That’s weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!What are you doing?!Relax?!Give it back to me now.It’s disgusting!It’s not sterile!Jim does a really good one. Do yours.No, no never.[imitating Cookie Monster] “Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.”What? What do you mean, suspend me?Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.Yeah. And he worked here too.No, no it wasn’t Andy. It wasn’t. It doesn’t matter. It’s not about who you’ve been with. It’s about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn’t know what it wants until it finds what it wants.Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek][answers phone] Hey Toby.Very interesting.[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.I don’t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.Yeah. “I vant to count to ten”.That would have been funny.",
    "Jim": "I literally did not know that existed until this moment.What’s up?Dwight, don’t be gross.Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. “Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.”“Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn’t been on in many cookies.”I think you need to go a little easy. You can’t just suspend someone form work.And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",
    "Dwight.": "Hello, Pam.",
    "Michael": "I’m going to give Erin $15.A one-on-one lunch with Erin?She’s kind of a rube.Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I’ll take her to lunch.[walks over to Erin’s desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary’s Day.I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to…[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.Ugh.Well, Hayworth’s is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I’m…Okay, well, we’ll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office][looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let’s go to Hayworth’s.All right.[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I’m kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.[shakes head, annoyed] I don’t know.Ahhh.Right. [sighs]An age or month?I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.So how are things going with Andy?Well, let’s see. Um… Andy. Plays the banjo.Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don’t think he is a snappy dresser.I don’t think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.Mm-hmm. You didn’t know that? Oh.Okay.I don’t know. Probably didn’t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.They were engaged, so… [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?Thank you.Mm-hmm. Yeah.Well…What are you doing? What are you doing?Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody’s looking at you right now.[turns to other restaurant patrons] I’ll have what she’s having![in Michael’s car] Did you have a… did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela’s not so great, so..No. No. No.Stop talking.Oh God.Andy, she’s not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn’t tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That’s like.. that’s like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can’t and won’t keep a secret.Erin?No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?Oh. Yep. I’m sorry about that. I feel… I’m sorry I caused that thing.Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn’t worry about Angela. She doesn’t hold a candle to you, Erin. She’s old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she’s, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don’t think she’s ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.You said butt.Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him:“Hey! Hey Scott!”[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? “Oscar. I am the Count.” Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",
    "Darryl": "I brought those in. It’s my birthday.  That’s some stone-cold narcissism right there.Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it][as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.",
    "Gabe": "This is violent and offensive.It’s awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]You have some food on your face.The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don’t respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I’m the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I’m an authority figure.Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It’s come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.And that’s straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that’s all. Ciao.Guys, why don’t we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?Ok.I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I’m sorry, Pam, but that’s it. I’m going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.Yeah, you’re right. You know what? Um, you’re suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.I don’t want to hear it. Suspended.[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can’t suspend them. Oh I can’t do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I’m glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what’s really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It’s not about showing you’re in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It’s about forgiveness. And yes, I’m talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.Great.Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car][walking back into the office] That was ugly. I’m sorry you had to see that.It’s tacky to discuss finances. It’s best to pretend that this never happened.Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] “Or cookies.”Alright.You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I’m one of the gang.Why don’t we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]",
    "Hayworth’s waiter": "Here we go. Hot plate.And your salad, miss.Yes?Of course. I’ll get you a bowl of pickles.",
    "Toby": "[standing behind Erin] I don’t think this fax is going through. Is there a different… I can just put it through again, you know.I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can’t dock your pay. That’s not legal.Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure…",
    "Oscar’s voice from the computer": "Hey Kevin it’s Oscar. I’m looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can’t seem to find the column for shipping cost."
