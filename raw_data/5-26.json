    "Erin": "[phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin… He’s not available right now… Uh huh… Yes… Sure, I’ll give him the message when he gets up– gets back.Thanks.[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!",
    "Jim": "Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we’re all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about… ten minutes.[whispering] Okay, I’m gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?[silently counting] Three, two, one… [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly][at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?Yeah.Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]Come on, who doesn’t like a picnic?I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.Well…Hey, how are you?Yeah.I don’t get it. He’s not even my boss anymore.No, I shouldn’t have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.Well, I could’ve died, so… I looked it up online afterwards.Nice job, Beesly.You all right?You sure?Hey, easy, easy…All right, you know what? You’re just trying to get rid of our best player.No, uh-All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let’s do this.[on the phone] Yeah, she’s with the nurse right now, so you’ll have to stall a little longer… No, don’t send in the subs yet… Dwight, I don’t know. Think of something![on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we’re so close! Just buy us a few more minutes… Well, they just called me in for an update, so I’ll call you right back… Okay… Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh… send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]",
    "Pam": "[whispering] I can do it.You had to be there.Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?Okay.Oh, don’t get us wrong, we like picnics.Tell them what happened last year.No, no, that guy who hit on me.Yeah, you don’t grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.Hey Charles.Do you want me to beat him up for you?Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?Maybe I played a little in junior high… and in high school… maybe a little in college… and went to volleyball camp most summers.[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!Good game!How do you figure?Let’s do this.[running for the ball] I got it![falls] Oof!Yep. No, no, no, I’m fine.Yeah.No, no, it’s fine. Just gimme a second.Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let’s go, it’s our ball. Let’s go!We’ll be back!How long will that take?I’m sorry, can we just hurry this up? I’ve got a game to get back to.",
    "Dwight": "[whispering] What do you need from me?Normally I don’t condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don’t know. [laughs heartily] No, I’m kidding. He’s just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.[changing the clock in Michael’s car] Like clockwork.Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!I’m gonna say 30.Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.Listen up everyone! I’ve gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim’s whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!Why? I don’t understand.Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.I’ll tell you what, I’m gonna do you one better. I’m gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.Sly dog.Come on, folks!Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!I could’ve gotten that, idiot!It’s not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let’s focus! Come on, you’re better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?![grunts in frustration][playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand’s on the net.Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you’re right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?Yes! We advance to the next round![playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!Don’t set it to yourself!What happened?You weren’t even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.Because if we don’t play, then the other team wins.Okay, knock it off, Rolph.Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-Rolph, leave it alone!Pam![whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I’ll stall ’em.Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I’ll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]Okay. Fine.Except, you know what? It’s not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?Seven? Can I finish please?Eight?",
    "Michael": "[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office][wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What’s so funny?Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let’s all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.See you later!We’re just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.Mmhmm. Yeah, that’s right.All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.Okay.You can go to hell. [laughs] I’m kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I’m going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one:“Holly, you and I are soup snakes.” The-and the reason is… because… in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn’t make any sense. We’re soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.What is up with you two, Holly?Cool. For who?Wow… I’m designing a chair. It’s part of your pants. You sit down, you’re supported.All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.You bet your fat ass we are.Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.That’s right.Newspapers for sale!I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.[watching her eat] What?Um, no, I just thought we’d wing it. That cool?We could do a movie… sort of thing.Oh!Could we get a Delorean?Oh! [to the theme of “Jaws”] Dun-der. Dun-der…Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]No. No.We’re circling it.[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it’s a sketch now.And now, presenting…[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]Yes, I am.Ohh, I’m thinking… I’m going to say… B, tour of Dartmouth College.[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!Yeah, I’m definitely getting in. I’m a shoo-in.I’m Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience’s response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I’ve ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.Yes!I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!David Wallace told me!![whispers] I guess not.Well… I didn’t know they didn’t know.Thank you.Well, he’s just thinking about his own gifts.Probably shouldn’t have mentioned Buffalo.Should’ve had hindsight.I think it went well. I think it was good.No, it was a tough audience.Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year’s sketch.Well you guys should hit the road before… I close down another branch.Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.I didn’t find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and… Maybe one year she’ll be with somebody, and the next year, I’ll be with somebody, and it’s gonna take a long time… And then it’s perfect. I’m in no rush.",
    "Rolph": "Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.Woah.

    "Kevin": "Michael, isn’t that Holly?[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]Set![Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!It’s six to six. It’s a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]",
    "Holly": "Oh no, I see they’re letting just anybody in here.All right.Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?Lemonade sounds great.Um, not much.I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]Okay, yeah.Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?Do you have a script for the sketch, or…Crystal cool.[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time… fix their parents. [both laugh]Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.Dun-der. Dun-der…Oh… We haven’t found our great idea yet.Oh.Hmm…Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael][now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you’ll get in?I’m Robert Dunder.Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!That is correct!The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!That is correct![pantomimes biting off Michael’s fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!They didn’t know?Hindsight.How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?There weren’t any laughs.Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.Well, I’m glad we did it.I can’t wait.What’d you think?[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.",
    "AJ": "Hey Michael.I’d love an iced tea, actually.We’re designing a house.For us.I like that. Put me down for a pair. I’m a size 34 waist.You guys are really gonna do this?I loved it.

    "Charles": "Jim. Pam.Nice day, huh?Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]Yes we are!Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I’ve been up for a while.Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.I don’t know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?Oh, Jim, you’re putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance’s health.Yeah, I don’t think we can let you play with that foot.I guess that’s it for you, Jim.Yeah, it looks like Pam won’t make it back. Okay?All right! Come on.",
    "Andy": "Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?If-Uh… [laughs sheepishly]That’s…… not what I meant.[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I’m concerned you might be in danger.Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You’re doing great, by the way.Are you blind?!Can you see things with your eyeballs?!Bump! I bumped it![playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]Dwight.",

    "David": "[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We’re still going to crush you though!Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.Okay, introducing Scranton’s Michael Scott performing with Nashua’s Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]Uh, okay everyone, we’re at a picnic today…I’m sorry, this certainly wasn’t the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.We’re- we’re closing the Buffalo branch.How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?What about the fact that they’re here today? What about that? That didn’t throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, “oh, this would be really funny.”Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, “is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?”Yeah.Dwight, come on now, it’s time to put in the subs.Dwight.Okay.",
