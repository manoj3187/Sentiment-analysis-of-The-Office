    "Pam": "[surveying an untidy office] The buildingâ€™s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, weâ€™re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.Well, it doesnâ€™t spin. Weâ€™ll just move the wheel one notch each morning andâ€¦ you see what chore you get that day.No, Iâ€™m familiar with spinning. Itâ€™s just that wouldnâ€™t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-[frustrated] â€˜Kay.Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.I donâ€™t think you guys understand why weâ€™re doing this. Itâ€™s-Iâ€™ve been through several rounds of development with the team and hereâ€™s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third â€˜chore wheelâ€™, excited] Weâ€™ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; itâ€™s more fun this way.[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on â€˜tiny wheelâ€™] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. Itâ€™s so cute no one seems to mind.[referencing the â€˜tiny wheelâ€™] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore][exiting house] Thanks, mom!Yeah. Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™s only gonna have hot dogs.Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.Think so.[taking glass] Thank you.[embarrassed] Yes, thank you.

No.[in the car] We still surprise each other.You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-Yes. But, what I didn’t tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn’t go because it was-In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?Tell me one thing about you I don’t know.And you thought you guys were millionaires.Yes. But there’s, wait, oh, there’s a funny ending to that story. I can’t remember.Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That’s funny. Shoot, I knew that one.Uh-huh.Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby]I think maybe there actually is something I don’t know about Jim.OK. Well, here’s something you don’t know. A couple of weeks ago-I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn’t tell you because, I don’t know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn’t know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you’d want to know.Yeah, I would’ve. What about you? Come on, there’s gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven’t had the chance to tell me.[looks knowingly back] Just tell me.",
    "Kevin": "[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?A wheel is supposed to spin.[spinning a new â€˜chore wheelâ€™ while everyone claps] Okay, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on â€˜mug dutyâ€™, disappointed] Mug duty?This sucks.Yeah, I donâ€™t think that you understand wheels.[grinning] Oh boy! What’s happening?[excited] Heifer’s International.

[gestures both men]Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. Itâ€™s not a nice letter.Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.You mean, put me on the news?Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.Whoo!I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?Yeah.No, I watch the news.This is a first for me. And, I don’t get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country.

If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.He sure did.Just, you sure Clark?No, I just, I don’t mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn’t feel good about that.I don’t think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.All right.Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?OK. [to Erin] I’ll call you later.[to Clark] So this is a single.",
    "Creed": "A wheel wants to spin, Pam.I know you donâ€™t really exist.I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.",
    "Jim": "[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandmaâ€™s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Royâ€™s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wifeâ€™s ex-fiancÃ©â€™s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that itâ€™s your wifeâ€™s ex-fiancÃ©.[to Pam] A banana?Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.[to camera] Justâ€¦ so weird.[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?OK.Uh, my ex-fiancÃ©.I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesnâ€™t know. Umâ€¦ actually I did tell Pam and we decided â€˜noâ€™. But, then I decided ‘yes’ anyway. So, Iâ€™m thinking thereâ€™s another conversation coming. And, itâ€™s hard to know when that will be.[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?Thanks for inviting us, by the way-That was, that was a surprise.You’re welcome.By the way, man, this place is… beautiful.Gravel company?Not gravel, obviously.

[Oscar nods]Ready?[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what’d they say? That’s awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!It’s not even real yet. And I’m not gonna tell her ’til it’s real.I’m sorry. This is for a news audition?[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.Uh-huh.[after a pause] That didn’t happen. You would’ve told me right away.Uh… [looks at Pam]God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.",
    "Pete": "Really? I got something?[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.Thatâ€™s really nice.[referring to the letter] Itâ€™s open.[whispering] OK.Uh, is it Duncan?No, Clark’s not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don’t know them.Seems unnecessary for an audition.That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca![whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.Now, I’d say Clark could be your co-host… he’s already doing camera.Someone who’s already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don’t know. [Andy smiles at camera]Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I’m his makeup guy. My hands are tied.Yeah, whatever you say, boss.",

This electionâ€¦ thing is crazy, right?[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that’s pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone’s receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want… [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?Well, I got a buddy that’s a big time local news producer and I can’t tell you his name, but it’d blow your mind.He’s looking for on-air talent and he’d kill me if I didn’t get you on tape.You’ll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we’ll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It’d be really tasteful and it’d really help me out with Duncan… with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.Think it over. [punches Pete]Uh… couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.Yeah, industry secret. You’re gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-I absolutely will do that.Pff. Guess I’ll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.Come in.Come on in.[to Pete] What’re you doing here?All right. We got that. That’s a rap, everybody.Yep, she’s done.No, we got it. We got it.OK, I don’t.",
    "Nellie": "[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.Today, I launch my big charity initiative â€˜Operation Give Backâ€™. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, Iâ€™d like to see him piss on that one.With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.There’s four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?Dwight, what about you?Thank you, Andy.Dwight, you will be participating.Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.Great, thank you.[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness’ sake, Dwight.Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you’re willing to live by their rules here.Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it’s mine now because I stole it.Didn’t you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there’s been theft. That means, you’re not serious or… someone’s getting their hand cut off.I know. So, it’s better that you pick another charity.In that case, you… [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people’s hands.Is it gonna be long?[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?That is absolutely revolting!He is so good, though.The way he just cuts off his arm.Well, he’s a genius, you know?

I mean, who knew it’d take off?Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?Oh, cool.So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]",

Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I’d be into The Godfather ’cause I’m black. Wrong! I’m into The Godfather ’cause I’m a cinephile. I like Scarface ’cause I’m black.OK, um, I like Erin’s hair. It’s a very pretty color.Um, where did you get that story?That was a good one.It’s getting late.

The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.Well, it looks like there won’t be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You’re welcome. [wads up Nellie’s charity sheet and tosses it toward her]Anything else would be inconsistent.[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don’t have a plan.What the? [follows Nellie into the break room][taking pen back] Gimme that.You’re insane.Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you’ll miss the most.Sounds like a plan.[places Nellie’s hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?No. It’s gonna be over before you know it.Heh! Ha!

No spoilers. Please.No.[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.Yeah.Yes.If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Whoopty doo.
