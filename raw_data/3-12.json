    "Michael": "Jim, could you come in here please?Sorry, oh wow, that’s so rude. I’m sorry, I can’t control him.You know what? Get Pam.Pam.Oh, that is gross.Damn it.Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.Oh.Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.You can’t pass. You’ve got to pick somebody.So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.Dwight?Here ya go. [throws laundry]Please.Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the “Amazing Race.” [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?No, we’re just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.Just bragging rights.It’s just… brrrrrr… It’s “Amazing Race,” Phyllis. Okay? We’re in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let’s do it.Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!Here we go.Ugh… that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.Hawkman.[Walks out of the Ladies’ Restroom] Let’s go. The men’s room was disgusting.Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.You know what? Let’s get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.No.Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy’s shoulder] Stop it.Yes.Ah, no. Don’t worry about it.What?I don’t know. Who knows how words are formed.Yes, Andy.He didn’t say.No, you are remembering it wrong.Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]Where were you this morning?Why do you lie, liar?You are lying right now.I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.Don’t. Don’t you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.Good luck.",
    "Harvey": "Hi, Jim.I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.Pam, you look very hot today.Me so horny. Me love you long tim.Long time. Me lobe yoy long time.You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.Boobs.",
    "Jim": "Hello.Yeah, you can.For this?Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael’s new friend.Oh well, ‘Yoy’ should bring in ‘Long Tim’ in one day. Shouldn’t he?Yeah. Right?Ok.Yup. I’ll trade.Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.Seriously? You’re going to sit in the back?You still do that thing?After you sir.Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.We have discount prices on ink cartridges…And, also, any forms that you are going to need…We can custom make them.Sure, that’s true we can’t compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.Hey, Kelly, it’s Jim.Thanks.Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.We should go on a double date.Sure. Look at you!Beesley, coffee?All right.Yeah.No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]Which one was it?Cool.OhYeah. Can I see it when I get back?Congratulations.Big deal.Ok.Pam? Did I ever have a ‘thing’ for her? No, why? Did she say something?Yeah. Ok, here’s the … I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn’t feel the same way. So, it didn’t amount to anything, and I left. I’m really glad you’re here. ‘Kay?Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]",
    "Pam": "Great.Who is ‘Long Tim’?I would love to meet Long Tim.Yeah.Ok. Bye Harvey.Really?Ok. Sure.Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.That’s great.Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I’d like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.$100.Cool. Congratulations.Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.Oh.Oh?Hmm. I don’t think so. But thanks. My building manager… is… You understand.No, thanks. I had some already.Oh, but, hey, Jim.I won an art contest today.Thanks.I sent in one of my watercolors.It was the new one I did.Yeah.Thanks.",
    "Kevin": "Angela.That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?Are you sure? It is a big deal.… Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.How much did you win?I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.Thanks, so sweet.",
    "Angela": "What?They arrived this morning.Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam’s desk]Thank you. [Puts candy back] I… I don’t want those.Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.Ok.This friend of mine – let’s call her Noelle – she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman – we’ll call him Kurt – he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That’s… I don’t know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?That’s great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.Mmm-hmm.Well then. Have a nice day.How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.",
    "Andy": "Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It’s like we are touring Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?Hmmm, well… let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don’t know. Michael Scott.Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a… motor… carriage.He does your laundry?Bueno.In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here’s the good news. Every success I’ve ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.What’s the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It’s really a pleasure to be a part of it. It’s like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don’t give up easily. I have walked two marathons.Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It’s in the Hamptons. My dad’s got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow’s nest. Also shot a deer once.Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don’t work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It’s in New York.Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.Ow.Oh man. Talk about your classic “Lame dash O.” Do we even want that guy buying our paper?I… I’m so sorry man. I really screwed that up.I really ‘Schruted’ it.‘Schruted’ it. It’s just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you ‘Schruted’ it. I don’t know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?Hey boss. Got a minute?I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?That’s weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That’s not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?Oh, doggie.It sure seems like he is lying.Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy’s such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I’m thrilled. So, it’s pretty… [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.",
    "Dwight": "Everything is fine. You are in the clear.Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?Yup?Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?Come on!!Uh, yeah. It’s the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.Leave the keys.Leave the keys!No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with… [Jim slaps Dwight]Can I use your phone?Thanks.[On Phone] One…Three…Seven…Sure.Erm, that’s one of the ‘Big guys.’ Been on hold this whole time.Here is my card. It’s got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don’t celebrate any major holidays.I like Karen. She’s pretty and appears intelligent.My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.No thank you.Hey, we nailed the sale!I overslept. Damn rooster didn’t crow.I am not a liar.Stay out of this, you!Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.That’s what she said.It’s going to be ok.That’s not the worst thing in the world. I’ll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won’t be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.Well, I don’t have a lot of choices.Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So… .I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.",
    "Phyllis": "We’re the same age and I’ll pick… Karen.Then how is this “Amazing Race”?Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis’ keys under the car.]Do you have a pole?Um-hmmm.It’s a big order. Thanks Kenny.Hey, how’s Annie?Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.I’m so glad you’re with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.You can pay me back later for the makeover.",
    "Karen": "Oh, uh, thanks.Wait, “Amazing Race” like, the biggest sale wins?Let’s go get a broom.Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?Yeah, thank you.Thanks. That was fun.Thank you.That’s nice.Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?Yeah.You ready Jim?So, let me ask you a question.Did you ever have a thing for Pam?I moved here from Connecticut…‘Kay.What happened on your sales call?",
    "Stanley": "Pass.… I’ll take the kid.You want the lead?Mind? Nothing would delight me more.Ah, Julius, how’s it goin’?So good to see you too. I’d like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.I’m gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?Ha ha ha! And you just said, “Hi! Hi! Hi!” Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she’s six months old!",
    "Ryan": "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after “Pass.”Is there a prize?Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?Yeah, if you don’t mind.Hi.Um… [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.Oh…Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.",
    "Buyer": "Yep.Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We’ve had some problems in the past.",
    "Kenny": "Oh, she’s great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?",
    "Julius": "Stanley Hudson.Great, great, great.Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?",
    "Guy": "Stanley.",
    "Man": "‘Kay. ‘Kay.Yeah, sure, go ahead.We’ll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.It’s very.All right, I get it. We got a deal.",
    "Phone": "Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.",
    "Kelly": "Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you … . [Jim hangs up]",
    "Jan": "Dwight’s name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don’t know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote “Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.”"
