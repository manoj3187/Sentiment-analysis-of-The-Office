    "Dwight": "I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it’s very exciting.For your convenience, I’ve broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it’s fine for the time being. Oops. Break’s over.[scoffs] Child’s play. Give me something hard to sell.Need any help?Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.Dunder-Mifflin.[scoffs] Paper company. They’re only one of Staples’ top competitors in the area.Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It’s your funeral. See how that works out for you.Hey.Same old.Oh my God, she told you?Accepted.[scoffs] The boss isn’t funny.I don’t get to wear my ties.So?I don’t want to do your laundry anymore.Thank you.You did this for me? [camera pans to “Welcome Back Oscar” sign]Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don’t need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]",
    "Andy": "[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays “Rockin’ Robin”]All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]I called it myself. I just thought you’d get a kick out of the new ring.Side note. I’d just like to say I’m thrilled to be working directly beneath you.I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you’re younger and have less experience.  So here’s to the future… Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna…The cost of doing business.Was the top salesman…[chuckles] Addition by subtraction.Mmmm. Yeah you’re right.Hey, boss.Noooothin’. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my “Lost” on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?Oh, well, I’m going to the kitchen, I’ll walk with you.[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin’ a lot of face time with the boss.Feel ya, dawg.Absolutely.You said… [makes gibberish noises]Which is like, “Right on.” And Pam was like “blah blah blah” and you were like “Yeah, psht.” Nailed it.Oh, no.I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli — ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! [“displays” Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed][singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.What’s going on?Where is my FREAKING phone?!Maybe you’re in the ceiling![trying to look in Phyllis’s desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don’t trust you, Phyllis!Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football – Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we’ll hit the tiz-own.Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.Fine. I’ll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy’s phone rings] Excuse me. And I’m also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it’s funny to steal someone’s personal property and hide it from them. Here’s a little newsflash! It’s not funny! In fact, it’s pretty freakin’ unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That… was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?Sure? Okay.So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don’t worry about old Andy Bernard. I’ll be back. Just like Rambo, so.Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be… Marcy!It’s so good to meet you!Yeah.",
    "Jim": "Is that you singing?Nice job.You gonna answer it?Yikes.Thank you.I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.Hey.So Andy is in rare form today.Encourage him? I’m the victim, okay? He’s fishing for me. We’ve got to do something.Fine. Party pooper.Hey, Ryan?You wanna pull a prank on Andy?I liked you better when you were the temp.Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?Okay, good. Stay right here.[hands Pam Andy’s phone] Are there any messages?So weird.No.What are you talking about?You know what?  Maybe it’s in the ceiling.Okay.[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that’s half-inch drywall.[imitating Andy] “It’s not freakin’ funny!”Hey.[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.",
    "Michael": "Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman…I said ‘was’.What does that even mean? That is impossible.But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody’s spirits.Hey, what’s up.Yep.I don’t know. Maybe.Bathroom.Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.Yeah, do you?What did I say?Huh.Oh, no.No, hey, hey. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.No, no, no. I mean, not because you’re gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar’s Mexicanity. So Phyllis… I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let’s get him one.Who’s that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.Hey guys. How’s the workload on all of Dwight’s old accounts? Handling it okay?Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?Really?Don’t – don’t do that. That’s not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.Nice to have Oscar back.Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.Um.No. I don’t want to do any of that.No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You’re going to drive me crazy.Hey.What’s up?Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.How’s this place treating you?Oh, well.No. I’m sure.So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.Ladies and gentlemen! May I present… Mr. Dwight Schrute!Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You’re gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?Guilty.Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.So does this remind you of your childhood right now?Wow. Thank you. Wow, that’s– thanks so much.And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he’s handing it to him]It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that’s what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don’t want somebody sucking up to me because they think I’m going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.",
    "Oscar": "Hey, everyone.Oh, that’s very funny.[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.The one of all women?Because I’m gay?OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I’ll join. I’d love to. That’s — thank you.I really have no preference. We don’t even have to have a party.Michael —Why don’t you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.Actually, yeah. I didn’t think I would, but turns out — [Angela walks away] it’s great.It reminds me a lot of the ‘Three Amigos’ with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.",
    "Kevin": "Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.Can I join too?",
    "Angela": "Oscar.Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?Yeah.No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I’ve thought about certain things. And I’m sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.Thank you. [sniffles]Never.Yeah.Oh. [hands Pam tape]No.I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.Yes.None of them. Especially not Andy.Are you enjoying your fiesta?Welcome back.",
    "Staples Guy": "You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.",
    "Pam": "Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?Oh, that wasn’t the night crew. That was Dwight.Oh, I’m kind of in the middle of — yes please.Nope.[takes the phone] Hmm.Angela?Is everything okay?Yeah.I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]No, I will not.",
    "MIchael": "Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy… just… there’s something about him that creeps me out. I can’t really explain it. He’s always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for “being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me.” I don’t understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.",
    "Lady": "Oh, no, thank you. I’m just looking.Okay. [moves away]",
    "Karen": "Hey.Yeah, you should not encourage him.Look, I’ve got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I’m sorry. I can’t.[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?",
    "Ryan": "What?Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.Yeah, me too.",
    "Phyllis": "Sort of. He had a lot of clients.No. Sorry.Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.",
    "Stanley": "Oh, sure, we talk all the time.No.",
    "Paris": "Really comin’ down out there. Commute’s gonna be hell.So um, where were you workin’ before this?What kind of company is that?I never heard of ’em.You gonna be like that, huh?I don’t like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That’s all I got to say on the matter.",
    "Everybody": "Yay. [scattered appalause]",
    "Creed": "Oh… Where did you get this stuff?Which aisle?Well, draw me a map, mama.",
    "Meredith": "Gerty’s.I don’t remember.",
    "Marcy": "Oh, hi. You must be Andy.That’s right, it’s so good to meet you.Thanks.  Well, you ready to have some fun?"
