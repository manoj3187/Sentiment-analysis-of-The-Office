    "Michael": "Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!Wet cement, outside. It’s drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don’t…Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!Here we go!Let’s, yes?Okay… Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let’s hear it!It’s drying, it’s drying…Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!Ahh come on!No!No!No!! Come on, gimme something good!Pam, translate.I love it!I love it more!I… love it!! Haha, come on![with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.[muffled] That’s what she said.Today is a very special day for me. And it’s really not about me, it’s about my grandkids, it’s about my great grandkids… I can come back here when I’m 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, “That’s me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole…” I dunno, it’s a good feeling.All right, everybody… Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You’re moving in the wrong direction…Ub, dub dah, don’t need, I can’t even hear you. It’s just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we’re going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.Ener-gize…Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven’t done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?Zing and pep, see that’s those are the kind of words we’re looking for. Yes, Jim?Now we’re cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme…An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?… Stanley, earth to Stanley…Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.Stanley, we’re havin a little…We’re havin a little brainstorm session……Good, this is good. I’m going to grab a glass of water.Ugh, what?What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.That? In the conference room?We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said “did I stutter,” and I said “wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?” It was joking, Toby, alright?Well you don’t get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you’re… you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another:“Hey um, you’re poor.” “Well hey, you’re mama’s dead.” That’s what friends do. It’s… you’re so white.Mmhmm.Okay, I will… I’m not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but…Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it’s probably psychological.I, uh, see that you… gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn’t mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing’s silly, isn’t it? Friends don’t need to apologize to friends as far as I’m concerned, so we are cool.Uh huh…GreatWhat’s the pink?Ok… Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?Other than me.I never said you could do that.I…Okay, I will think about it.No.Hey.Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?It’s an advice question, and if you don’t wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It’s, um…I know, it’s very, very personal…I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?God.Okay.Okay, so dig this:you’re on the street, and one of your gang disses you.Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?What is that?Really?I would’ve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.It’s like a mock execution.Yes it is a good idea. It’s the only possible solution I have left.No, okay… I’ve had enough of you.Because I want you to behave as if I’m actually firing him, Oscar, okay?I’m not firing him. I’m not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I’m going to do, is I’m going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I’m teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That’s all I’m, okay, here he comes. Let’s just… play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?Stanley Hudson, you are fired.I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.Hmm.Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.That’s it. And uh… do you have anything to say to me?Okay…Yes.That’s not-All right, all right…Okay.Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.Everybody, except Stanley.[starts to cry] I don’t understand why you keep picking on me.You just, do, and I don’t know why, so… please help me understand.Well Stanley, maybe you’re feeling that you don’t respect me because you don’t know me very well.All right, you don’t respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can’t talk to me that way in this office, you just can’t. I am your boss. Can’t allow it.I am good person, and sometimes, good people don’t get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don’t get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, “I don’t respect you!” Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don’t get no respect? Airplane food. Why don’t they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don’t get no respect, some–take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don’t get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What’s the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don’t get no respect!So I’m thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.You know, I don’t care what he did to me.  He’s mean to other people, that’s what gets me.  He’s just…Everybody.  He just, he’s always, he’s always talking about people behind their backs to me.Like that people are stupid, and that they’re idiots, and that they’re sluts.Because he’s mean.  He’s, he’s like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is…And that Angela’s a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.I know, I know.  I think it’s tiny.  I think it’s too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.Well, he’s just mean.It’s complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.Okay.I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I… jerks don’t deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble… jerk stand.Pam, stand up.Pretty disgusting.",
    "Pam": "Michael we don’t know what you’re talking about…She’s talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.[wearing glasses] Um… yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend’s house and, I forgot my contact solution, so… I had to wear my backup glasses… Shut up.I don’t have my contacts…Don’t, don’t–If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.Oh, thanks.Oh, okay…I should probably get back to…Entering the….No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?Because you’re very important?What does that mean?I can’t find my glasses.Okay, okay.What kind of stuff does Stanley say?Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too.Really?Huh.  Maybe I will.What’s it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I’ll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I’m 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I’m gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can’t see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can’t see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael… it’s great.Hi, can I help you?[pointing] Ryan!Yeah.Okay.I’ve heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]Okay.Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.",
    "Kevin": "Michael you could put your initials in it.Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.All the girlfriends that I’ve ever had have worn glasses.Yeah, it’s kind of a turn-on for me actually…Like librarians.Could you just say, “these are due back Thursday”?Michael, if you hadn’t told us this, then we would’ve thought that you were actually firing him.[chuckling] It’s Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he’s mad. So that’s about it!",
    "Jim": "Yeah that’s true.If you were a real star you would put your face in it.We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea… Maybe the idea of a man.Greatness is only skin deep, some people say…Well that’s not true. Other people believe it’s deeper inside…And in this case…That’s also not true.You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly…Would…Well, it’s too late, because I’m proposing… that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?An urban thing…Oh boy…On a wing and a prayer, mostly.A formal warning… [chuckles][stammers] I’m sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn’t mean to go over your head.I’m sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I’m not sure what’s really…Oh we were just… talking about, bureaucratic stuff…Yeah…That’s not a good idea.Who?Let’s go.Okay, you know what? Why don’t you take my hand, and leave them, and let’s get out of here.Who else is he mean to?Mm-hmm.Hey.She’s never worn these glasses before.Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.A formal warning, seriously?And no one cared.Productivity?  My numbers are good.",
    "Phyllis": "We– we–Well–When I was a little girl…We-we found some wet cement in the park…In our neighborhood…What did we write?That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]I like your frames.Oh, well, I’m already married.  Boys don’t make passes at girls who wear glasses.",
    "Andy": "Here it is, you should draw a picture…Cause that says, that says…So much more than words…[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective…Good one. Okay, you ready?[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. “Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good… cat food?”What about a cat eating man food?What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more… zing, and a little more pep?You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there’s an Xterra next to you. They’re always driven by chicks, so there’s your icebreaker.That’s a racing stripe.Mmm, I doubt that very much.How next to?I have to pick one of those?Can you go over those options again?Well I have the, the blue book value…Can I think about it?Let me think about it–Let me think about it–I’m thinking about it–Thinking–Yeah. All right!What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You’re flipping my car for profit.I gave you a deal… based on what you said to me.",
    "Kelly": "Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good…Why would he say that?Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time.Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.",
    "Oscar": "Michael that doesn’t seem… safe.Why are you telling us this?",
    "Dwight": "Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]Can you breathe?Hold your breath.Ready?And… go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.Andy and Angela seem very happy… I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.Uh, bumper’s sagging.This car’s crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.Well, here are your options:you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff… you can donate it to a person that you’d like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I’ll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.Yes.You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It’s gotta be now.Seal the deal. Let’s do it. Let’s do this thing. Three, two, one–Five, four, three, two…Now. Now. Now.Say it. Do it. Now.Do it now.Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line–green for money-sales, get it?There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley…However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.Menstrual cycles.You.Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.All you have to do it say it.Just say it.Say it. Just do it. Don’t think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two… do it. Give me control. Michael… I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.So… All right, well, you’re gonna have to deal with this yourself.[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What’s Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!It’s my car now.Yeah, well… seller beware. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.I’ve got a Madlib for you:a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",
    "Angela": "Um… tall. No, no, uh, nice.Mmhmm.[laughing] It’s a man eating cat food.",
    "Stanley": "Not me.No.Leave me alone, dammit.DID I STUTTER?What.What are you talking about?I am not going to apologize to you.It’s like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I’m wrong, and if you don’t like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I’ll say it to my next one too.Are you serious?You’re firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I’m gonna let you do this to me?I’ve watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I’m filing a lawsuit, and I’m gonna tell them about every stupid thing you’ve ever done up in this office.So I’m not fired.Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?Do you have any idea how to run an office?Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.And I think, “there’s no possible way–He can top that.”But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!Oh, for the love of God.Fine. Here it is:you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I’ve gotten to know you, the less I’ve come to respect you. Any other theories?Fair enough.Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]",
    "Toby": "Can I talk to you a second?Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning…Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.Yeah.He didn’t seem like he was joking.Alright… Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking…Um, why don’t you go ask him that?You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter’s stomach hurts when there’s a mean girl at school…I’d say all the goofing around at Pam’s desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him… w-with PamWell, you can actually fire him.Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.But now it’s being looked at as more of a productivity issue.I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they’re not good enough.",
    "Creed": "A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody’s business. I’d like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I’d also like to see her topless.",
    "Darryl": "Mike.I’m very busy here, man.Why?No, no, no…No, um… I have.Both.Yeah them, and the Latin Kings… the Warriors…Newsies.Oh my goodness.Well see, um… in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.That’s when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just… start tickling them.Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you’re laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you’ve forgotten the whole thing. Ya’ll can just go to church together… get an ice cream cone.Well, it’s effective.",
    "Ryan": "[to Toby] I think it’s self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?How do you live with a franchise this bad?Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.It’s actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.Woah, don’t get all defensive, alright? It’s just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?Yo!Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.The only good bagels anywhere.Same with coffee, and women.I’m gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here’s what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him – that’s a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it’s all bunched up.  As he’s fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]",
    "Meredith": "Hi, Pam."
