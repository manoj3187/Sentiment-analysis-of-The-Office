    "Michael": "Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth]Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]Hey.[gestures to ‘Bed & Breakfast’ magazine] Is this good?Oh. Okay. Ed’s Tires, huh?I really appreciate it.It’s for your trouble.No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.Yes, I do.That was four years ago. Why don’t you let it go?Ed’s Tires. Why don’t you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat][on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you’re charging Ed’s tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?I’m not following you.Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I’m getting your drift.Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you’re writing?Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying “He’s talking about you!”][Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don’t you?Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?Dwight?Is the cool new guy Charles?Is it Stanley?Hello, Dwight. What’s with the shirt? Are you alright?Oh my God! Run! Run! It’s a setup. Setup!Dwight, run!You be cool.Just-what’s going on?Mm-do… Dwight would not-I. Understand. Nothing.[Michael storms into office] Wow.It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.It’s like, a girl says she’ll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don’t know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don’t know. Is that clear enough for you?Hello, traitor.I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.I’m just getting hardcore with him.Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me… Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?Wow. High score?Hello, Dwight, I’ve been expecting your call. What do you want?So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There’s no-Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.Toward the sun.Noon.You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]Dwight.I hope you’re not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.So you just rat me out? You could have said no.If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.I do too.Cooper’s.Damn it.[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?Really? That’s weird. We didn’t see any.What?Yeah, sure.Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He’ll be here in a sec.[Michael answers phone] Yeah.Dwight, not now, we’ve been robbed.No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You’re still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying “Dwight did it!!”] You?What about our truce?On purpose?Why?Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!Dwight, do you mind if we talk?If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.Oh, one more thing. I’m going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.Oh, uh oh, I’m turning you down right now.You can hear me, but I can’t hear you.Oh, great. Mr. Schofield’s ready to see me. Thank you so much.Walking in the door…Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I’m closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office][on speakerphone in Dwight’s car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?That’s very rude.I’m going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin…Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.Good, good, good. I will see you.I color code all my info. I wrote “gay son” in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means “Orange you glad you didn’t bring it up?” Most colors mean “Don’t say it.”I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn’t feel as important though. That’s just how the world works, I guess.[muffled speech, Ryan, Michael, and Pam all have mouths stuffed with cheese puffs, Michael answers the phone and talks with mouth full]He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can’t make you feel good, then I don’t want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.He’s undercutting us big time. He’s actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.Betrayal ain’t just a river in Egypt.",
    "Pam": "Things are a little slow here. And there’s only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there’s no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone’s face.We’re getting pretty good at it.[Pam and Ryan throw cheese puffs to Michael,  Ryan and Michael throw cheese puffs at each other, Michael throws a cheese puff over his shoulder to Ryan, all three throw cheese puffs to one another, give high-fives][Pam yawns, two cheese puffs thrown at her, one sticks in her hair]The timeline’s messy.I’m confused. Am I walking down the aisle to ‘You Can Call Me Al?’I don’t know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.Mm-hmm.I’m not gonna do that.I’m here. I’m a part of this now.Michael, are you alright?Tell us what you’re talking about.We can’t help you if you don’t just tell us what happened.Michael!I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.Oh my God, I think we’ve been robbed!When are you ever responsible for your actions?It’s good. But won’t it feel weird cutting into a cross?I don’t think so, Andy.",
    "Jim": "Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for… several years. Wait, no, that can’t be right.Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?I think she just didn’t want a crucifix cake.Am I going down a road?It’s so scary how right the things you’re saying are. And you’re coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.Hey, Andy. You know I’ve been thinkin about what you said--I just don’t know if I can do it.It’s just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I’m pretty emotionally needy.[both laugh] You know that I was doin’ this.Okay.[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.Yeah, well, with you it’s different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!Why? When I look in the mirror, I don’t like the face that looks back.Forget it.I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]Oh, God.Hey.Okay.Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don’t think you’re ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.Sorry. Her day.Are they looking at me?Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",
    "Andy": "This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing ‘You Can Call Me Al’]Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch… $9,000.Did you even hear the music I just played for you?What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.‘Noishe.’That’s interesting, because I hear what you’re saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I’m like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I’m so happy. I’m so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim’s fist] Ah, what’d you do that for?[fist pound each other] Totally.Hey, Jim.Bro, I do that all the time.Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?Well, so what?  Your body’s a ten.Jim.[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.Okay, Tuna.Hello.Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here’s the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don’t know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here’s the deal, ok? It stops now.Oh, really?Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin’ here?Uh, that’s not what was-Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it’s Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.Don’t think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.Yes!Hey, bud.Who?Are you sure?",
    "Phyllis": "What’s wrong with you?I think you look nice.You sound worried.Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]",
    "Dwight": "These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.Doesn’t Charles know he’s compromising my attack readiness? It’s not a dress code. It’s a death sentence.‘Kay, thank you. It’s a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody’s worries. And in that chaos, I soared.Hey. Ed’s Tires is thinking of making a change.They have some great kitchen ideas.It’s small, I know.Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?Wh-  I don’t need $6 to help a friend.Michael, you know I can’t take this.But don’t forget you owe me $10.Michael.You needed to speak to me?I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.Your concern is noted.Like a wolf. Thank you.Really?[sighs] It’s firm.I don’t know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something’s come up.No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It’s not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they’re changing fast.Imagine… Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there’s this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.Good, do you see what I’m saying?No.No.It is possible that I could be talking about us.It is the situation that we are in now.I’m not a barbarian.I will.Yes?I’ve said too much.I’m sorry, MichaelI did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I’m okay with it.[on phone] Dwight Schrute.I think you have the wrong number, Michael.[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?Dammit! [hangs up]I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I’m not worried.And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we’re all making observations! [gibberish sounds]And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you’re considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it’s not exactly like ‘Highlander,’ but still…I would like to arrange a truce.Meet me in our spot in four minutes.Michael.In which direction?At what time?That-[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.Michael.You were making me do things that were not all right.And not come through for you?I want a truce.Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo’s.I had fish yesterday.Oh, hi, Michael. I’m so sorry I’m late. I got stuck in traffic.I hit a bear.He’s technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael’s office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael’s desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]Did you enjoy your lunch?No, Michael, you were sabotaged.Me.I broke it.Yes.You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you’ve created. You have unleashed the wolf!And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don’t say.[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, “great salesman, better friend.” [turns card over] “Tall” and “beets.”And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you’re begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.Sure. That’d be fine.This is war and that is what happens.Oh, no. No. No. No. No.Michael! Michael!Don’t let him in! He’s a traitor! Michael!Are you saying you invented paper?It’s not the soil! It’s the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]Spin move.Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!Come on.What he’s not telling you is that he will abandon you.Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how’s your gay son?How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?",
    "Charles": "Looking good.Dwight, take a seat.Nah, that’s weird. You’re gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin’ lately?I’ve just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn’t go unnoticed.Yeah, I like your work ethic. You’re so… focused.And I wanna start givin’ you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?Definitely.[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.No, Mich-Michael.Michael, no, let’s be cool, ok?Yes.We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you’ve been pestering him for company info.He did.Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?",
    "Ryan": "I can get there.Oh, awesome.Yeah.Finally.Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.We can spend a couple days there.Uncle Dave?That’s my family. When you mess with my family, I can’t be responsible for my actions.Get off my ass, you hag.",
    "Michael, Pam & Ryan": "U-G-L-Y, you ain’t got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!",
    "Secretary": "He’s in a meeting.Mr. Schofield’s ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.Uh, hello, Dwight.Oh-",
    "Automated phone voice": "If you’d like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]",
    "Stanley": "So, you think Michael’s going after the whale, huh?",
    "Mr. Schofield": "Michael, good to see you.Really?Dwight, I’m in a meeting.Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-Why don’t you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?Uh, ok, sure.Excuse me?",
    "Kelly": "Hey, guys.",
    "Kevin": "I guess I could be nicer."
