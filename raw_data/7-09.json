    "Dwight": "[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We’ve got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.Try “Big Boobs” with a “Z”.All RightYes.[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it “Hay Place”. Eldred Called it “Hay World”. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that’s all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!Roll in the hay, five dollars.Oh, our contract.Yes, why don’t we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh… I’ve got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.So, uh… [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?All Right!Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn’t get me off the hayride! But it’s gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing… and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year’s hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for… Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let’s hear it for… Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick… [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight’s worker claps]Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see’s a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]",
    "Michael": "[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.Uh… try “password”.Uh… it was like eight years ago?Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been…  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.The important thing is… this kept us secure people.Morning.[wearing Ryan’s glasses] I’m Facebook.I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven’t heard anything back.A what?Dot com!I think an investor’s ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I’ve never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.Your kidding?!You and me.Don’t you work here full-time?Mm-Hmm.That does sound fun to me.Excuse me, everyone… SEX! Now that I have your attention…MONEY!Pervert.That’s good to know. [screams]Wuphf! All right, I’ve warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.Whoo!We already have a buyer.At least.That’s right!Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.Look at that. Triple your investment by January.There you go.Do not talk like that, Stanley.Here we go.“It’s Ryan the WUPHF guy!”“He’s up there.”Look at that! He threw ’em on the ground!No, it’s not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.I won’t sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn’t that right?I–yes. We’re not selling. I will not sell.Can’t talk, saving the planet.We Don’t? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.No, I won’t even consider it.Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.I think you are wrong.You may be right. I may be crazy.I’m just saying that I think I agree with your point.I thought it might make me feel better.[singing] But it just may be a lunatic… [stops singing] No.Good, good, bro.Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?Nine days, though. That’s, like…Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.So you would think that’s a good idea for me to do?Mm-Hmm.Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so…Tonight?Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.Hello.I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.I’m not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he’s also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn’t, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody’s money.You can’t have it.The world sends people your way… Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you’re dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That’s easy. Gimme a hard one. That’s what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam’s a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So… [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That’s Uh…Thank God.",
    "Jim": "Uh, it’s saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? ‘Cause otherwise we can’t do any work.Nope.No.Okay, I’m not doing every number.Why don’t we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What’s the name of the guy in Glasses, again?I’m trying everything.That’s– [ding] the password. We’re in.[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will–I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let’s be honest–if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob… I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]Mm-Kay, Well, it can’t be zero, Kev.What are you talking about? We–we have a commission cap?A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?Nope.Okay.Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I’ve cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So… what now?Pam. Okay, now I’ve tried everything.No.Yeah, it’s not as fun if I’m not blowing off work.[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles][hovering over Meredith’s desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.Talk to me.[listening to and editing Jo’s book on tape][puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe][opens door to Gabe’s office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he’s on the phone] ‘Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.",
    "Pam": "Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?Lord of the Ring stuff? I don’t know, I’m just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.You’re typing “Big Boobs”?Mm-Hmm?Okay.Oh, it’s okay.Let it go.Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It’s actually a great idea and I can’t believe it didn’t exist before. And I know Ryan’s kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I’ve done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.What do you want to say, Michael?Really?! Who?!Did you prank Dwight?Well, you like that.I love you, but I’m kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.Ryan, just tell us your plan.Oh, God!I move we sell!Sell.Hi, Michael.Oh, we don’t recycle.I’m sure no one asked you to do that.Listen, I know you really like Ryan–Michael, I… [sits down] I hate to say this, but… you know this special bond that you’ve always felt with Ryan, where, like, you’re best friends or you’re his mentor or something?Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he’s taking advantage of you.And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.Don’t.Yeah, but in a jokey way where you’re gonna start singing.Okay. Go Ahead.",
    "Erin": "Um, everyone was getting their driver’s license.Sure.Pam.I don’t wanna be a lousy snitch.Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator–But it’s not for–All that color.",
    "Andy": "I got it, try, um–[Coughs]I’m sorry, nine days until what?Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?You have his email?That sounds weird.Yeah, sell.Your doing the wrong thing. You’re gonna lose Michael’s investment. You’re gonna lose ours.If you tell Michael to sell, he’ll sell.All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say “aye”]You’re gonna lose all of our money.",
    "Kevin": "Big Boobs.Wow.Commission comes out to… dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, “dunh-duh-na-dah!” I’m pretty sure I timesed it right.Dunh-duh-na-dah!You had me at “Sex.”[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome![stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out?

    "Angela": "Nosy?Hey, I’m kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.No, I meant… [motions you and me]Mm-Hmm.Perfect!You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.It’s a new corporate policy.[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]Where have you been?! I’ve been waiting.No, I–I think you should make time for it.Dwight?Sure.Probably.Mm-Hmm.Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don’t laugh at me.Oh.Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]Thank You.You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.",
    "Ryan": "How’s It Going?Hey, I’m WUPHF.What’s up Facebook?You should’ve sent me a WUPHF.[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up][getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.I love it.Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.New Investors are key, though. That’s actually why I came in today.[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven’t invested yet.Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.Awesome.How’s everybody doing?!Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I’m describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]For my current investors, things are going great.Washington University. I don’t even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.So I’ve decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.No, no–Oscar, it’s not–it’s not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.Fun, communication, connection.Well, it’s tight, as with any start-up.We have nine solid days. I love these questions.

Wow, what’s falling on us, man?!” WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don’t think about the money. Ever.Baby, Baby, Baby–No, no, no, no, no.I help you with your things and you help me with my things.[whispering] I got this, it’s okay. Don’t worry about this.The Washington University Public Health Fund.The domain name. Yeah, they do.Have some faith in this idea!Yes. You alone do, actually.Michael, how’s it going, bro?Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.Look, I know I’ve tapped you so hard.[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You–people, people don’t give you enough credit.Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don’t seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot–Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.We totally should.I gotta work on this.Yeah.

See what I mean?Nudity makes me uncomfortable.My gym allows it. I wish they didn’t, but it’s policy.
