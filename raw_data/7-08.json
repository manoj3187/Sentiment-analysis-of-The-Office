It’s just that it’s our first party together so…[sad] Okay, sorry.Wait which one?Good me too!I don’t know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there’s this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don’t go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.Mhmm! I’d love it if you were there.You and Michael are always the life of the party!Why would I keep you from coming?Why would I hide it!

Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]Look who I found! [points to Michael]Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.What’s the longest thing you’ve ever seen?

[runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow][on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan][collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there.

[Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.Kevin!Yes, I am. Are you?What? No Gabe is… Gabe is not the boss.Why did you just say he was the boss?Yeeee… Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?Uh huh…Big…All right![interrupting] Okay okay okay.Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I’ll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I’m ready for bed![tossing pizza dough in the air]Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]Where’s Michael? Where’s Michael? We can’t start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!

All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I’m dead. Okay?[Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.Yeah, well I wasn’t very hard to find.Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?So these are pizza dogs, they aren’t pigs in a blanket per se.Well…He’s the longest baby in this room.You know what Erin you do have to.[grimacing] That’s what she said. [leaves][outside opening Gabe’s cable hookup box] Okay… Alright.I just went out for a walk.What? Really? That stinks!What does that mean? Party’s over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?Are you kidding me?Now that’s going on?Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don’t know if it’s gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I’m gonna give it shot. [hurries out]No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.What is there to like? He’s just, he’s a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?Why?

You are are, to see that boy, anymore.As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.Oh do not raise your voice to me!Gahh, I will pull this car over![enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl’s heart, I will kill you. It’s just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl’s heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl’s gonna turn my hair gray.",
    "Kevin": "They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.No! I bet he’s wishing he was strangling someone!Hey, you going tonight?Yeah! You gotta go to the boss’s party!No he’s not the boss.‘Cause, you’re the boss![getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!I can’t believe we’re missing that!Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!",
    "Dwight": "[sighs] They shouldn’t televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that’s a show I’d watch.Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn’t follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I’ve been raising children since I was a baby.That would be nice wouldn’t it?You know it’s not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe’s refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she’ll be happy for hours.Really? Oh… Then here we are.She loves me.Well something’s come up, I have to go.I have something to do.I do. But you married my worst enemy.Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.From Jim.Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.No, try me.I’d prefer for him to think of it as degrading.No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I’ve gotta go meet Angela.I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We’re in the real world. Sex contracts exist!Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.You ever been with the blondes before? It’s the big leagues.She’s in heat. She will eat your face off![to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.What are you doing?",
    "Angela": "Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.Are you going? [to Dwight]I would watch that.[whispers in Dwight’s ear] Outside my car in two minutes.What are you doing here?Are you authorized to do this?Ok, uhm, then tell him that we’ll do this tomorrow night instead.Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?You know what Pam just save it.",
    "Gabe": "Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it’s another Waco.So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here’s what’s been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and…You don’t really toss the dough.[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.[takes remote] It’s a little loud…[lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.I’ll just turn the captions on.That’s for the other box.Let’s go ahead and wash our hands.Yep! Waste not right?Erin you don’t have to…Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.It’s still on upstairs.See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves][Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?How much?I’ve got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one’s called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]",
    "Jim": "Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson’s funeral. Things that if you didn’t see them live, you wouldn’t really care that you didn’t see them at all.[confused] Okay?You play? [referring to keyboard]You can’t even do that.[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.Okay… [changes back to Glee][whispering] Hey.I don’t know about, love…Well I think enemy’s a strong word. ‘Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-I don’t think that’s gonna…What kind of pizza would you like?That’s not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.Okay… [puts pizza into Dwight’s mouth]You need to stop talking.[unbelievingly] Okay…I’m going home, and I’m taking my baby with me.I’m not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]",
    "Kelly": "Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up][reacting to Erin’s invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn’t know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he’s this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!And what was with Jesse’s sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it’s just. It’s irresponsible.Finn.Rachel.You have to stop.You know what? I’m so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? ‘Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from…The show’s back on, what happened?Oh my God what song was that?[texting] What song was it?Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] ‘Cause we missed it!Ahhh! What’s going on?!?!Good luck Michael!",
    "Andy": "I bet he’s wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.[to Erin] You’re having a party at Gabe’s apartment?You would?Try and keep me from coming!Try and hide it, I will track this party down!No what?Yeah.Oh thanks.Why does Erin like Gabe?That’s really nice, thank you.[pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass][enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn’t that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?My nanny used to wear that.I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe’s doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.[muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?What does this say?[confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin’s in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it’s here. Oh if it isn’t the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady…Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?You’re four seasons in a day. [heaves] You… got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue… [stops, is struggling] It’s Spring Time in the Rockies!No!

    "Pam": "She’s up! Great!Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I’m up all day and I’m up all night. And if it doesn’t stop soon, I am going to be up all night.[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It’s closer to the TV. It’ll seem louder.You have a gun in your desk?Maybe I should go.If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.I can’t even talk about it.I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.It’s a miracle. She loves him.No no no no no! She’ll wake up!Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I’ve always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?Absolutely! [starts out]Do it!Jim, just don’t think of it as degrading.

Even just for tonight!No no no, don’t. I will go talk to Angela.The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves][knocking on Angela’s car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It’s Pam.

It was magical.Magical…",
