[gasps] Huhhhhh!Ah, French. It’s a great language. If you’re a chain-smoking acrobat.You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.I could teach you if you want. It’s a lot easier than French.[exclaims] Atherozar!It means “excellent”. And we have begun.I throat-rip.You throat-rip.He/she/it throat rips.More of a, barbaric growl.Louder! You’re shouting it from the back of a horse!Daraas!Daraas!

Is everything okay?Great.Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.[to Jim] I’m sorry, I’m leaving you alone for lunch.You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.Brake lights.

Red!Well, since we’re stopped at a light, uhhh, here is…the mural I did for Angela’s baby.Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh—no! Here. It’s, uh, a text from Andy. “New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.” And then in parentheses, he wrote out “as soon as possible.”Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.Oh—gee—I’m—Brilliant!Ummm. Oh! I’ll say he’s related to Richard Nixon. It’s an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.I’m sorry.

And—[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]So what did you want to show me?Yeah. It’s really uglyYou mean me?Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!What?! No!

They all speak more than one language. Usually when I’m there!Yeah!  Let’s do it![shocked] Oh!I was intimidated by Andy’s family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She’s gonna be like, “What’s your stance on politics?” Or, “What is the best war to do?” And, I will just be like, “Duhhhh!”Foth aggendak!Foth aggendi!Foth aggenda![in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!Wah!! Aggenda!!Addor!Qazer!Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!Vos!Because of your slaves.Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for “slave master”, “attafrauk!”, is a term of respect. I’m learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?Dwight, you didn’t tell me you were teaching me a fake language.Dothraas! chek! [giggles][in agreement] Hmmm!",
    "Darryl": "Oh, ok.It’s all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I’ve been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let’s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we’re here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It’s called batching.Life hacking, man.Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.What?! Really?[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That’s cool, man.Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.Yes, yes, yes.I included some time saving ideas…Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn’t be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.You’re gonna po’ mouthActually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—That could work.I’m going for a walk.I’m done. I gotta get out of here.It’s not just today, it’s everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.Hmm. Yeah rightLike what?What kind of job?Hell yeah!That sounds awesome!I love Philly!It’s not even a thought—What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

    "Nellie": "Hmm? Oh—oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I’m mean, I d—I just don’t wanna—burden you with my massive stress freak outs!It’s just that I am taking my driver’s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I’ve had no time to do that, thanks to “Demandy”…[Points to Andy’s office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But…in who’s car?[sighs]Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn’t give you paper cuts. We can’t. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.comWell, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.Mmmm—the thing is Pam, I’m gonna be eating while I’m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.Whhooooo![laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It’s almost unbelievable!Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy’s head].Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.That’s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, “looking for dirt.”Pam, I’m related to Tonya Harding.No! I’m just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.What should we say about Jim?My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair![sighs]. How can you be sure?You’re a cocky little thing, aren’t you, Pam?That is quite an ugly wall, isn’t it?Needs something, doesn’t it? I’m thinking…a mural.Yes! You! You are soo talented! It’s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton’s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you![quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I’m gonna find you someone better, and rich.And Filipino. But we’ll break that to her later.[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can’t bear to watch this.",
    "Andy": "[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.As in…[silently mouths] Wow!This is super-flattering. She’s the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh…I’m related to Michelle Obama.[Clark and Peter clap]There he is![shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?It’s me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.I mean, it’s distant, but…Right?Darryl said, “Cool, man.” He called me as cool man.What’s going on here? I’m related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].Why? Is it employee’s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.Does anyone else think it’s possible that I come from slave owners?[everyone raises their hands.]Hey mom, it’s Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America’s national shame, thanks, Bye.[Continues] Where were we? Uhhhh, yes. Okay. Your…productivity thing.Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!Huh huh huh. Look, I’m not gonna lie to ya, I’m a teensy bit distracted right now.[snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd.[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I’m trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.Not my slaves, my ancestors’. Maybe. Probably not.That you’re learning a made-up language from HBO’s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today…but this was a great nerd-out!Hi guys.Yeah. You don’t have to ask me.[Phyllis lets out stifled laughter]Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be—[ringtone of Dixie plays].  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes” by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith—African American—Mambazo.I’ve done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I’m not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol’ family closet. For example, Phyllis’s great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.No. Not that I see here.You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!Dwight’s grandfather was a—[is interrupted by Dwight].I was gonna say he was a tax evader.And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.No, I’m proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it’s in the past and it’s not our fault. So we don’t have to talk about it.Might’ve done. And how… do you figure?You know, there’s nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I’m not gonna apologize for my family’s wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society…if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.[ringtone of Dixie plays]  Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.[answers phone]  Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?[to the group]  She said no! Take that![gets back on phone]  Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?[speaks quietly into the phone] I just asked you! Why didn’t you just say that?[continues speaking quietly] Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That’s—no! I don’t wanna know that. Ok. You’re interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.[faces the group] Well, turns out the Bernard’s of yore did not own slaves.We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.[Clark begins to clap but Pete immediately stops him.]Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I’m trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.Exactly. Help me po’ mouth, Darryl.What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I’m doing all the heavy lifting. I’m coming up with all the ideas here.[with a sigh] Okay.I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.",
    "Nellie and Pam": "[giggling] ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!",
    "Jim": "Don’t worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I’ve been wanting to try.That was really good, Darryl.Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me—[gets interrupted by Andy].Pam always says I look like Nixon. That’s crazy, right? I mean there’s nothing there. True—[touches his nose] Oh no.You doing alright, man?Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?No, I’m serious. There’s always something better.Like hypothetically… if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.Something cool. Like, sports marketing or… that sound something like you’d be into?Right?Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you’d have to…Right?Not even a thought!  It’s not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!Oh, it’s happening!  Let’s just keep it between you and me for right now.We, uh, we haven’t talked about. But I think that she’s—I think she understands… what this is.What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?I don’t know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.",
    "Pete": "Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.Yeah, me too. It’s weird. Hard to remember what’s real at this point.Hey Erin!Oh—okay. Sorry.Fonas chek!",
    "Clark": "So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.Oooohhhhhhhh![They clap when Andy slams dunks his garbage into the bin][They clap when Andy prints a paper copy out][They clap when the water cooler jar makes bubbles while Andy is standing next to it.]It’s starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.Just clap through it, man.",
    "Oscar": "I’m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?Well, if there’s another explanation, I don’t really see what it could possibly be. I—[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain… negative connotations. Most likely, your family were—slave owners.The difference is, Andy, that you’re the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.Your family’s rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.Really?",
    "Phyllis": "You think that Andy’s family owned slaves?Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?",
    "Stanley": "Well somebody owned somebody. And I don’t think anybody would buy an Andy.Do not care.",
    "Angela": "Ew.Stop it! Stop it! You’re frightening me!",
    "Kevin": "And John Wayne?Wayne Johnson? The Rock?Yeah, that—you’re being really mean, Andy.",
    "Meredith": "Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela’s throat]"
