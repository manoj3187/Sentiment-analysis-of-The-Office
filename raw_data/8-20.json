    "Pam": "Hey Jim. Stanley’s back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?It’s nice. It’s funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.Yeah he does.Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]Oh! [takes out earbuds]Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.I’m sorry, we’re throwing a party for someone because they’re being horrible?I’m still not sure why this woman is even here.I know, right?Phyllis!Hey, what’s up?So we’re planning this party for Nellie, and we’re gonna make it really bad.No. We’re gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.What?[laughs] Okay.What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don’t have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]Or what if…We discuss… [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.What are you talking about? Yes we can.Okay, they’re almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]No, that’s a great idea. Let’s have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?‘Cause there’s someone already here named Pam.Oh! [laughter, murmuring]That’s not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.Hey Hank.I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.Yeah, he came and went.Let’s just- let’s go.",
    "Jim": "Oh, great. [reads] “Glad they didn’t mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.” Oh that’s not good.Stanley doesn’t have a moustache.Okay, the man’s worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley’s face]Iâ€™m sorry, we’re taking work time to move someone’s personal belongings into their new apartment.Why is she here?Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? ‘Cause to be honest, I don’t think it’s gonna fit through the door.That was one time-[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.That’s moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.Sounds like every other party.Oh! Hire a magician.Trust me.Yes, you should.[reads] “Nellie, don’t open, stupid. Love, Nellie.”I doubt that they’re sh-Whoa. Who is this guy?Boyfriend.Like a boyfriend?Yeah. Whoa. Here’s one with his face whited out.Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.Oh, Nellie. I’m so sorry. We were just…Shh!Dwight!I’m so sorry. These must be very painful memories.No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or…[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let’s give up on all this mean stuff.No, that’s not what I-Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It’s way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit… enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there’s some stuff in her past that you guys don’t know about that’s a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.No. No.Oh, I’ll do it. I will volunteer.I’ll do it.[picks a card] It’s the four of hearts.Not true. ‘Cause that’s not a real place.Well, turns out he actually made it up there.Night-night.",
    "Phyllis": "Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.Oh, I don’t know. Now I think he doesn’t.He does have a moustache.I can’t believe he’s making us throw a party for her.It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.On purpose.Order carrot cake. [laughter]Toots, we’re not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.Welcome to your party.",
    "Oscar": "Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I’m not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.Actually, Nellie, this monologue you’re delivering is very offensive.What does that mean?She’s always late, she’s always rude…Yeah.Listen to this.We’re in far too deep. We can’t change course at this point.What I mean to say is we don’t want to.Plus everyone would know who you meant.To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.",
    "Angela": "‘Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don’t stick our noses in other people’s business.[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]Pam, we have a great idea.We’re going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It’s gonna make everyone sick.Okay.I knew she’d crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.Nobody’s named Monday.Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I’d be if Pam died. [laughter]",
    "Dwight": "Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.Yep.Yes!Okay, okay.Why Jim?[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.Don’t listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? “Oh, I think I’ll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.”I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.[shouting] Haulin’ cube!I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.[finds shoe box] Ooh.I have to see these shoes.Oh!Here’s the two of them taking a hike. I’m guessing he’s some kind of friend.Here’s the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I’m guessing he’s some kind of close romantic friend.You read my mind.Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he’s a hated Italian politician.Why not call…That’s awful. What kind of restaurant.If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.Okay scram, wizard.You heard me!",
    "Gabe": "[bell dings] Guys, that’s the elevator. What if it’s him?[reveals Stanley’s moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!",
    "Robert": "“Good morning, Robert,” says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!Is this a video conference you’re having with “Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz”?People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?Ah.[laughs] I’ve never believed willpower was very important in a woman.I don’t think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.No, no, no, no. There’s something going on. Some stress in your life.Nellie?You’re clearly under a lot of… stress with the moving and the work situation you’ve found yourself in.Let’s help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.The rest of you, let’s throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.Cheers.no, Nellie, she-Oh, no, you-[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?Well Nellie, I’m sorry. If I’d known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.",
    "Nellie": "Sorry, sorry, everyone, I’m late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.Oh, here’s what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!Ah ha!Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.Well, yes, uh… there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?Ugh! I hate that! No offense.oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]If you’d let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?Yes, Robert!Yeah.Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let’s not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.[walks in] Oh.I see you’ve discovered Benjamin. That’s what I call my box full of photos of Henry.God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.I couldn’t afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what’s ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don’t tell anyone about this.God, no. That’s the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?Jim, could you give us a hand?Why thank you.Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they’re brilliant employees, in their own way. Don’t you see what I see?",
    "Kevin & Meredith": "[in unison] Yes.",
    "Kevin": "None taken.Shh, here she comes!You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?",
    "Stanley": "Who’s a native?",
    "Andy": "[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents’ cabin in southern Pennsylvania.Mm-hmm. It’s a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.Oh. Hmm.[sings] Time to have a little kiss!Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.I believe in that.I think that’s important. That is important. Bummer, but important.Mm-hmm.…and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.Consider it nailed.Okay, here we go. Jessica, I’m really sorry. I just need you to know-I just need you to know-Wow. There’s a lot of cars here. This is just weird.Hey, Lauren. Look at you.I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I’d stop and say hi to Jessica.Why is Erin with me? That’s a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.Yep. This is Erin.Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-It’ll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?These are delicious.Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don’t know Matthew’s history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don’t know.  I just- I don’t think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don’t pop that one.Hey.Oh! Ah, Megan.Aww.Oh, he’s out there.Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so…[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes…No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?Uh, maybe we could talk in private?Well, first just let me say that I hope when I’m done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I’m gay.I am gay, and I prefer men.You did not, Kenny!I like hanging out with you. You’re a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I’m gay.Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.Well… I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-Understandable. And I’m really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So… we should probably… go.Right? Rough scene.Oh… at least we can kiss now.You know, that stuff that I said about you to her… I did- That’s just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.Yeah.Oh yeah.I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I’m not gay. In fact, I’m so not gay, I’m in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she’s right there. She’s sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.Okay.Bye guys.",
    "Erin": "[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.Oh. That must be nice.Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.No.Yes.Yes. So do I.Important.Well, Andy, I’m upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I’ll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.[vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.[whining] What?What is it? I didn’t sleep well last night. [they laugh]So, I’m Erin. Hi.Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica’s friends and they’ve been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?Andy-No, uh, I’ll just have some gummy bears.But… they’re penises.Maybe we should just go.That was a really rough scene.Yeah.Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah… I feel really tired.Probably from seeing that turkey.When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.What? Why are we-Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]",
    "Lauren": "[knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?Well, I know. Look at me.Aww! [clicks tongue]Oh. God.Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she’ll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy’s here!Oh, Jess! [claps] Look who stopped by after his business trip![pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause]And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan]You’re done!Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away!I can’t believe you’re not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss]",
    "Jessica": "Andy! Hey!Hey.Sorry. It’s kind of a madhouse.I dunno.Uh, yeah, sure. What’s up?Uh, yeah. What is it?You’re breaking up with me?Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn’t relationship material and she wasn’t as good as me, but it’s her, isn’t it?What?Andy, you’re not gay. I mean, we were… together. And you seemed pretty excitable.I can’t say it doesn’t make sense…Look, it’s fine, Andy. I didn’t think we were gonna get married or anything. I just… I’m just upset for now.What are you doing here?Go away.",
    "Party guests": "No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]",
    "Megan": "[grabs Andy] Ahh!You are one of the good ones, nard dog.No, really. [to Jessica] Where’s my Andy?Aww. Are you going to sing for us?That’s not like you. That’s not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who’s here.Why the hell did you come back here?",
    "Darryl": "Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.",
    "Ryan": "Hey, that’s not a code name. That’s just an insult.Yeah!Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.",
    "All": "Hey!Cheers.We hate Pam! We hate Pam!",
    "Creed": "Everybody get comfy now. This first song’s over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, “Have you heard my originals? They’re terrible.” They said, “Even better.” I said, “I get it. It’s an ironic party for Nellie.”We hate Pam. We hate Pam.",
    "Kenny": "I knew it!You invited me to go shopping with you.Get lost!You’re disgusting!Yeah get out of here.",
    "Magician": "So we’ve established--that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just… disappear? [sets off flash paper]Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you’re my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?Oh! Big guy, huh? How’s the air up there? Watch out for… birds. [chuckles] All right, let’s uh- let’s do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is… I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn’t just do that on purpose, did ya?Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.But I never could seem to figure out those knots.[yells] What the hell? All right, where’s Phyllis? Who’s Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-What?Huh!",
    "Woman": "Get out!",
    "Various": "Don’t come back. [someone throws food at the car]You don’t even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!",
    "Hank": "Yes ma’am.Yes ma’am. I got my eyes open.What? That ain’t right.Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don’t think he could’ve used… it couldn’t have been…"
