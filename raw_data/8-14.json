    "Jim": "Oh ho! Look who’s back reporting for duty.Nope. It’s over.Nope. OK.Ooh, me three.I just got a text from Robert California that says “bring your clubs to Florida”.I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?“Robert, Hey!” Exclamation point.“Got your text, awesome idea. Let’s hit the links next time you’re in PA” Dash JH.Yeah, it’s a golf text.Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.Ok, sending.Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.Now, is it too dark to say that Cici’s having an operation?I think you’re right.Total nightmare.Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. They’re incredibly helpful, you’re lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won’t even know I’m gone.You know Dwight, if you didn’t want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn’t go.Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]Essential.Alright, I’m gonna pack my trunks.Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that’s gonna make us roomates.Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you’re showering. Save some water.Is that the buzzer from Taboo?Mosquito.So, what is this special project?That sounds awesome.Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?Bye.I will.",
    "Pam": "Hey guys![laughing] Hi.Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.[laughing] Well, it’s not exactly a vacation.What?!Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin’s allergic to walnuts. You’re allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?Aw. It’s OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.When did you find time to do all this?Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It’s really good.So you guys, you know what’s an even more useful treat…is cash. So-…we wanted to say thank you-Really?I’ll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?Why? Does he think you’re going to Florida?No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it’s like wha-what?? Just do one.Well, let’s hear it.I like it so far.It’s perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.Total golf text. Send it.Ok, read it back to me.Good. Doesn’t sound pushy…you’re just stating a fact.Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.I think you need to go to Florida.It’s only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it’ll be..I was going to say good because I’ll have all the help I need?Exactly.Alright [kiss]Bye. Call me when you land.",
    "All": "Hey.",
    "Andy": "Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she’s no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!Dwight, I have exciting news for you.I think you’re going to like it.Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email… from corporate….that told me that…That…[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that’s not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.And here’s some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.Yeah, it’s weird that I said that last one.Uh yeah, look at that.Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?They’re not expendable exactly, I just can’t…I can’t think of the word I’m trying to find.Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here’s your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you’re also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.You have your team.Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]Well uh…well the deliberations were confidential so…I feel like we should respect that.Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!I use the word “guys” a lot when I’m nervous…guys.Guys! Guys! Guys!Guys..Dudes…the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.Wha-OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I’m happy to hear you out.No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.Five to six hours?No no no no.Nope.Thirty minutes!Or both?Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.Thank you.Thank you.Yeah, wow. It’s almost like we’re not all experiencing the same winter?Well…Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?Well it wouldn’t be hard to find someone to fill in..Tuns, I’m really sorry. You’re too essential to the operation here, I can’t let you go.OK, listen up everyone, here’s who’s going to Florida: Kathy..….Stanley..…Ryan……Erin……And, Jim.Safe travels.Oh, K. It’s only three weeks.",
    "Phyllis": "Are you glad to be back?I have a new swimsuit I need to break in….",
    "Stanley": "You still had eight weeks more than we did.What?!Respect it? You’re trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.If anybody’s going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn’t a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I’m the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.Why is it so hot in here?How did a mosquito get in here?",
    "Angela": "Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I’ve got brownies and magic cookie bars.I don’t know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?I wouldn’t know, I’m watching my weight. Ugh.Ok, it’s obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.My baby is not a monster!",
    "Dwight": "What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin…family baby. Four days ago.What?You can’t tantalize me.OK. [looks at watch and leaves]If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man’s life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, “perfect pork anus” which I don’t mean.Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I’m going to be living for the next three weeks.Mm hm.Eh! No plus one’s. This is for competent workers only. And don’t worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.God, you’re such a spy.My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who’ll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won’t be missed. We don’t need idiots, good for nothing’s, methheads or… What’s your name?Kathy.Yes.Oh my god.Are you kidding me?! I’m supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We’d never get off the runway.Oh god.Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?Oh, no big deal. It’s just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.Oh, I’m sorry Stanley, I can’t share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I’m sure he had his reasons.I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.Good point. But we’re gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it’s gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there’s an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy’s office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren’t picked and maybe you could just clarify?Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.Great idea! So why doesn’t everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.Three to four hours.Two to three hours…Come up with a statement in the next hour….I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What’s that? It’s not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that’s all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.Ok. Thank you Kevin, we’ll let you know.Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.Maybe it’s what she does here…You know I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?I wouldn’t say that…it’s a bit much.Jim is essential to th-Andy, Jim is just too…essen-…This is stupid! Cut.He doesn’t even want to go.Oh my god.What?No.No!(Bleep)You’ve gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!Let’s go, step it up you runts. You infants, let’s move.Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you’ve ever faced. They’re gonna be hard, they’re gonna be dirty. You’re gonna wish you were dead.But? There’s not buts. That’s it. You’ll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON’T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I’m done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says “I’m gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt” unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband’s colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight’s forehead] oh. What was that?[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.Ok, Florida team, let’s reconvene.So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we’re at corporate.Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.It did, it did.Oh, I like it.No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that’s not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.",
    "Kelly": "Damn girl! Your body!You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.Why?Hell yeah.Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.For you maybe.I don’t know how I’m going to live here without you.Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.",
    "Oscar": "Angela, you look amazing.It just feels like a slap in the face.We’re not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.…Andy.",
    "Group": "[murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats]Stop it!",
    "Kevin": "Extremely, but I’m gonna fight through it.Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman’s gotta take off his cape.Hey!Because I feel like that I’m in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there’s like a crazy mismatch or something…When do we leave?",
    "Erin": "And here’s the fax for you.Ah! Love to learn.So… [points out their matching heart pins]We’re pin twins.Yeah. That’s cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy’s still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don’t know, I wouldn’t mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn’t want to spend that much time with Jessica.Absolutely. Works for me.[laughs exaggeratedly]Hey guys, any spots left?I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.I’m going to Florida…..and I’m not coming back.Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don’t have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don’t write it down unless you like it.Goodbye for a very very long time.",
    "Darryl": "What do we have here?Val knit me a beanie. But I can’t if it’s a “we’re just friends” beanie or a “I’m hot, you’re hot, let’s get it poppin’” beanie. So I’m gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we’ll get to the meaning of the beanie.[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It’s like the nation of Islam down here.Oh, this is a gift, for….my man Nate here.Yeah.Hey.No, no, no. Maybe just later.Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.[on phone] This is Darryl.Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?We’re friends. We’re friends.Yeah sorry, I’m just looking for a pen.Back off! I got my reasons.Hey what’s up? You called?It’s cool really.“This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack”Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.Your mom?Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom’s name is Brandon?Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.",
    "Val": "You’re wearing the beanie. You like it?I like to knit, don’t hate. And who’s that for?Wow. Those are really nice.Cashmere.Can’t wait.Thanks, they’re from my mom.Yeah.Yeah, that’s her.[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom’s name is Brandon.",
    "Nate": "I love it too Val. It’s it’s really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can’t really peg it on the hat.What?Darryl, you shouldn’t have.Can I open it?Ah, I can’t wait. I’m sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.They’re so elegant.How’d you know?[reading card] “I’m glad you’re in my life. Happy Valentine’s Day.” Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.Oh Darryl, hey.Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn’t get you anything…No, it’s anything but cool. Now I haven’t really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]Yeah, they’re Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they’re all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I’ll find you.",
    "Kathy": "Kathy.[On phone] All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim’s gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It’s three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?",
    "Bob": "Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.Yeah, do you know her?Cool. Um, so can I get that address or…?Why do you need a pen?",
    "Meredith": "Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.I am…",
    "Ryan": "What are the criteria for going?Stop calling us “guys”.Stop. Stop it Andy.You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That’s myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That’s what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team…or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.But…No no, I want to go.You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?Right. Think different, from Apple.Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I’m not going to need it down there.No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.",
    "Creed": "I’m out.",
    "Toby": "It has been a long, lonely winter.It is real, thank you for saying that."
