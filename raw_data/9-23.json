    "Dwight": "The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I’m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there’s a mini-reunion. A kind of a “where are they now” panel at a local theatre. It’ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven’t seen Kevin since we let him go.[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is…for…Kevin.Go ahead and just read the frosting.Uh-huh.It’s a colloquial way of saying “you’re fired,” Kevin, which you are.The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.Based…on his merit.Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here’s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.That is all. Have a good morning.[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he’s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band “The Grass Roots” in the 1960’s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won’t be necessary tonight.Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he’s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.What? Ooh!I thought you guys couldn’t come.Uh, better ask Jim.Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn’t on the itinerary.Jim…wha… Come on! What…what are you gonna whack me, Jim?A bazooka. You remembered.[tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.Woo! Okay!Amazing.[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?Oh, Thank God. We are famished!No, we haven’t ordered anything. No one’s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]Oh, we do. So we’ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that’s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef’s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won’t work. That’s no good.Now, for the last time, I’d like a side salad with balsamic.You’re telling me!What for? We haven’t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren’t deep fried, right?Oh, man, never thought I’d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]Good old Mose. [laughing]Oh, great. He’s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.Right. Which one is that?Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.Waste of a good hatchet.I heard you say “well” the first time.It was nothing personal. It’s just that you were terrible at your job.No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.That’s it.I missed you Kevin.Ohh.You’ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]No. We can’t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.With today’s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it’s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]Oh, no. What?Oh, come on. I’ve never heard of such a thing.Not… significant is a big word…I think you’re only a teeny…Jim.[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can’t believe you came.Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They’ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ‘em on in there.[After Dwight and Angela’s dance]Everybody!Good night.Good evening.Hey guys.Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?No, don’t say it. You’re fired! You’re both fired!Don’t be an idiot. It’s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you’ve been here. That’s the max.Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you’re ever in the area, you’ll always have a place to stay…in my barn.Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don’t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So… have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let’s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So…yes. I’d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.",
    "CameraMan": "We’re getting bonus footage for the DVD.It’ll be a pledge gift.",
    "Kevin": "Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!Yes! Wait, why?“Get out.”What does that mean?I’m…good.[crying] At least I got chocolate.Well, well, well, well, well, well. That’s six “wells.” Did I get that number right, Dwight?Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!Well, w…You’re just saying that to make me feel better.Is that all it was?Come here [hugs Dwight]I missed you![watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It’s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.Where’s the, uh, basket for gifts?Okay.[reading] “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. “That’s not…[to Oscar] What was that stuff?Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.Oh, I don’t know.Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith’s drawer] What the…there’s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.Yes!If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it’s that if you film anybody long enough, they’re going to do something stupid. It’s only human natural.What is it?Oh, Yes!Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I’m gay.[sniffles] It’s just that I’m so emotional.No, but maybe the reason…",
    "Stanley": "Ah, I’ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.Hey guys.Oh, great.Yes, I’m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.I missed you too.I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.Okay, I need a drink.",
    "Meredith": "Speech!Thank you.Andy?Darryl!Whoo-hoo. Let’s get this party started!Shut up. Jakey?No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom’s not here.Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper’s only as good as his song.Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn’t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.You have to go, Toby.Hey, bottom drawer.I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they’re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You’re not alone sister. Let’s get a beer sometime.",
    "Pam": "What? Dwight, you can’t do that.Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone’s ever been fired, Toby’s blocked it, so…[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?I think she looks good. Now that she’s wearing sports bras, we don’t see her boobs as much.[enters] Darryl! Andy!We’re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I’m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn’t you be?Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How’s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.Oh, boy.Wait, wait. What?Uh, that seems inappropriate.Whoo-hoo…go, Meredith’s stripper son.No, no, I’m fine.Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don’t know. I’m working on something.[pause] I’m sorry. Is there a question?Oh, um, well, you know, I… I just… I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you’d been filmed for nine years of your life, there’d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.Listen, um… I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn’t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he’s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it’s better than a fairy tale. It’s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you’re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.Yeah, like Harry Potter.Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it’s choreographed!He just so happy to have a family plan.Is it me? Is it Nellie?I need to get out of this dress.[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?Okay, Okay. Um… so… this past year has been really great, and you’ve been great and I just… I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn’t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture… and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.About 2 monthsYeah.Well, you… you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.Austin? Maybe.I’m doing it for us.Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?I wanna do this.I really want to do this!We’re so excited.Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper…,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I’ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]Everyone, Let’s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just…I kind of meant just everybody from the office.Okay.[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I’m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn’t work here anymore.I didn’t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It’s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It’d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I’m a tragic person. I’m really happy now. But…it would just…just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself “be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn’t that long.”What about the honeymoon?I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing…And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We’ll come back to visit. But I think it’s time for us to officially…Thanks Dwight.I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all…I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that kind of the point?",
    "All": "What?!Dwight…[overlapping objections]OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka]Ohh…[screams]If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.Stanley!Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats]Awww.Hey!",
    "Oscar": "Ooh.[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby’s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you…hold on.That’s the reason Kevin got fired. It’s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] “A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.” He was home by 4:45 that day.You’re back?Whoo, whoo, whoo.Yeah!They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I’m a man. So I’m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.WASSUUUUP! [laughing]Yeah, brosef.Well, I bet it was a smash.Is that a volunteer program or…If you want her to leave, just tip her.What is that?Thank you David.You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It’s not much. But if you see it in the right way…And that’s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn’t once show me doing my origami.Why do you say that?Yeah, but you’re not gay. You’re not gay.You’re not gay.",
    "Jim": "Umm….I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it’s good for the environment too.Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.Okay, the limo’s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ‘cause I want to pack in a lot.Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight’s night, okay?Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He’s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I’ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight…only good surprises. “Guten Pranken”. [chuckles]Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn’t going to show up?Mose has been weird? That’s so unlike him.Hey man, good to see you.Hey!Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? “Guten Prank” number one.And Jim will say nothing.Yeah?Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo’s here. Let’s do this. Change if you need to.Get out.No, Dwight. You’ll be doing the whacking.Of course I did.Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.Private Room.Enjoy, enjoy.Okay, man, easy.Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?Oh, it’s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela’s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.They think it was Mose.Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you’d ever set foot in in this town?Mm, hey driver. Why don’t you take us to 3030 Adams?Is that Mose?Ooh.Nope, not a prank. I think it’s time for you to bury the hatchet.Okay, just talk.I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow’s his wedding day. You can’t be anything but happy on your wedding day.Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or…Right.Am I the only one that’s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?Doesn’t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that’s fine.O-Kay.Um, you know what, I actually didn’t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.You ready?Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um… I don’t know how to tell you this, but… we have a little bit of a problem.The minister just told me that it’s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.I haven’t heard of it, obviously. But I’m out because I am significantly younger than you-I think it’s definitely… Well, okay. Either way…Either way, Dwight… I can’t be there for you. I’m sorry.I just…really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]Best prank ever.[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don’t owe me anything.I gotta get out of this dress.What’s going on?No, really, what’s going on?Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?That’s why it’s so clean.I mean, you were gonna do this without me?Oh… okay. Where would we go?I promise you, you don’t have to do this for me.The last…[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about…You wanna do this?You really want to do this?[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear][whispering to Pam] Let’s go outsideYou know what? Maybe we should talk.Athleap.Dwight, come on. Don’t end on a bad note.Hey, and if you’re ever in Austin…There it is.Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes…and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that’s…an amazing gift.Thanks Phyl.I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn’t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid…wonderful…boring…amazing job.",
    "Toby": "Yeah. Yeah, I don’t think…Hello! [laughing] Hello!Hi! [goes to hug Nellie]Oh. [laughs nervously]Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ‘cause they have to give you one month’s notice before they leave.Yes.[dancing with Pam] [sobbing][sobbing] It’s everything.Good luck.Oh, I don’t know. I might turn in early.Yeah. I’ll stop by.",
    "Crowd": "Whoo! Yeah",
    "Angela": "[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She’s disgusting. Those feet. They’re like the paws of an orangutan.[laughing] To remind you that our wedding’s gonna be wonderful.D, it’s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.I don’t…I don’t know why.This is my big sister Rachel.[laughs] We’re very close. We even have our own special language.People love it.What? [knock at the door] Okay.Wait, what is this?Okay…Rachel, are you all right?Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It’s o…thank you. You know what? You don’t have to…oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It’s okay.That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?Will you lock the door?Alright, see, you don’t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It’s the wind. Just come and shut…[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.No, my heels aren’t too high. It’s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn’t know. As long as I can get to the altar.Hi.Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?Do you even have a mattress?",
    "Phyllis": "Oh, some fudge?Thanks.[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.After 16 years, it’s strange sitting across from somebody who isn’t Stanley. But…he’ll get there.[hugging Andy]. Andy…Andy, I’ve been worried about you. How are you?Poor, poor Andy.Angela’s special repairman is here.It’s just the wind.Okay. [opens door] It’s just the wind, see? Nothing.Let me help you us.Oh, I’m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson’s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It’s me. It’s me.Cool.Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.I’m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.",

    "Andy": "Yeah, sure, I’ll talk about it. Why not? American’s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say[on computer]Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.[SNL Weekend Update]After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.Hey-OH!Yeah.Thank you. Yeah,Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.A little warm.[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.Hey!Didn’t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?Hmm.No I didn’t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.Surprise!Hey! Pam!Mm-hmm.Aw!Jim, it’s fine. He’ll just get you on his cell phone and then that’ll go viral.Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.That’s how I got my new job in the admissions office.No. It’s a job. Things are going great.Yes.I’m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can’t end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. Burned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things – You’re just not good, you’re just not good. – Are you insane? – You’re just not good, you’re just not good. – Chill out! [crying] Just sit here and cry…I’ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]Ree-De-De-De-Doo!It’s only 6:00. Come on, everybody’s going.[on the computer] You’re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn…[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you’re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.Thanks Dad…Darryl.I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I’m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I’m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they’re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.",

How long have you been stalking me?No. And I thought I unfriended you.[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will… who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me.

More just like, “Mom, I hate you!” And then she would say “go to your room, young lady.” And I’d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we’d just have dinner together. But I don’t know. I’d have to meet her. Thanks.Yes?Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]I don’t know. I’ve just always been really good at dancing.How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day?
