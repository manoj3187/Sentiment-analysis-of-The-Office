    "Michael": "Coat! [throws coat at Pam]Steak! Where’s my steeaaak?Get me Armani.On the phone.Where’s Armani? He’s on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I’m so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]I owe you an apology.Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won’t ruin it for you.Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what’s best for you, Mo Chuisle.I haven’t heard the same about you. So let’s just go with mine.We already have a sofa. So why do—It… folds up. You’ve only seen it flat.I— Ok. How much is this going to cost?Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I’m sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I’m going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.It’s just that you say it’s gonna cost what it costs— [phone rings]Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.Use to have two cars, traded ’em in, now we’re down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.You can not, I have a thing tonight.What?Oh no, I have a thing tonight.How about this weekend?Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.You wouldn’t understand. It’s a secret.I’m sorry Mr. O’Brian, I didn’t mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won’t be that fast, but it will–[notices camera]– it will be that easy.I just love sales. I love it to death. It’s as simple as that. And I don’t get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.No, they’re with me, so… this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!These meetings are useless.Very inspirational. [laughter]Or a trained seal. [laughter]Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?I’m just calling because you responded positively to the—…Stanley?[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your—[speaking with a different voice] Have you— Have you considered satellite television?Well your son sounds like he’s really motivated. I think it’s crazy the coach won’t play him frankly.You bet.Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes—It is not a waste of our time.Vikram doesn’t have my people skills.Well, I hope this conversation has helped.What did you get tonight?Oh, that looks good.I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.Thank you.Really?Wonder what I would’ve been back home?I know, but it’s competitive here. What’s a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.I would’ve been chief of surgery… Or a cowboy.You know what, here’s the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he’s just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he’s an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He’s invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It’s not Terminator.I actually wrote a movie.I’m writing one, yeah.Um, sort of a spy, thriller…Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin’?Okay. How’s yoga?Wh-Why not?Okay.Good night Vikram.Hey, congrats on the bonus.I’m gonna have it one of these nights.Good night.Um… that wasn’t much of an introduction.Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we’re gonna be talking… about…PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!Yes I forgot about Ryan’s presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that’s what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register— Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.Why?No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.My other boss, Mr. Figaro.What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one’s business but mine and my other business’.It won’t.Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]Why don’t you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?Huh, okay.It’s whoever, not whomever.No, whomever is never actually right.Not a native speaker.Well it sounds right, but is it?Thank you.No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever’s name is Toby, why don’t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.I’ve never done this before. I’ve never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company—And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can’t do this.I am.I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.Hey Kevin, you’re a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don’t know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he’s tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?Do you know anybody in the mob?Okay, um, Oscar, I’m going to need to take another advance on my salary.Hey guys.What’cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what’s going on.  You’re talking about Jim and Pam, if they’re having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think—Hey, hey, hey.Monkey problem? No, I’m not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?Oh, I hate monkeys.I don’t have a second job.  Maybe I’m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.I don’t talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.I totally agree with you.  But I don’t have money problems, I don’t.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]Yeah, but I destroyed it, it’s not even useable anymore.No you didn’t.How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.That is a good point.Like the witness protection program.I’ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I’ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I’m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That’s the life.I… DECLARE… BANKRUPTCY!I didn’t say it, I declared it.Yeah, tell me about it.You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she’s using them as if I’m made of money, she thinks I’m a human ATM machine.Oh, that’s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that’s how they got a core.Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.Right.How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.We will find another way, we’ll ask power-point.You’re a presentation tool if you think I’m gonna tell Jan about this.No you’re not! Ok, just… you’re not a tool. Look, we’ll tell her that it’s bad, but it could’ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.She poses.Um, that’s, how did you get that from what Oscar’s saying?What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I’m getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I’m never coming back.Hey Jan.Not much, what’s up with you?I’m out of answers Jan.I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.I don’t know that.I’ll stay off the grid.Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.That’s really nice of you to say.I think the engineer left.Don’t sell your implants please.That’s nice though.It looks cute though.I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like “don’t pay for six months” or “you can transfer your account from another card”…Do you think I’ll get any new ones?  I could… [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]What do you mean, “what”?Were you listening to what I was saying?What is the matter with you?Yeah.Yeah.All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves]Yeah.  What?Um, my CDs.I do.My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case LogicAnd, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What?I’ve been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn’t even like.  No. [shakes head]I can’t.I can’t go back to that.I don’t know if I can do that.  I can’t see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.We will?  I can’t.  I don’t have an idea in my head.I have…Okay.  What?  Um…Tell me.Well, please?  I won’t tell anybody.Yeah, I will.",
    "Pam": "Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.He’s a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’s identified with her character.A suit?Like the main company number? Because I’m gonna have to call information.You finished the movie.No. Go ahead.Mo Chuisle. He’s watching Million Dollar Baby… He’s gonna try to kill me.[on the phone] Michael, it’s Ryan for you.Hello, I’m looking for a room.It says here you cater to the eldery.Trip Advsior.Two?Shoot!We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.You wouldn’t understand, Jim. It’s a secret.The Beets Motel.Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!I don’t know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]Oh my gosh.What are the themes?Irrigation.What?Yeah. Coward.[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?It’s ‘whom’ when it’s the object of a sentence, and ‘who’ when it’s the subject.How did he use it again?What’s up?You’re being gross.What moves?I can’t believe that’s not working.Um, I don’t know if I really see you two together.She’s very religious.Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.That’s right, you did.Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn’t do that to Dwight… or Angela… or Andy.Michael.What’s going on, why do you have a second job?Doesn’t Jan have money?Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.Table making never seemed so possible.The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.We really did.  It was fun.Dwight.Hey, I was thinking about dinner— [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]Okay.Yeah.Jim’s just really passionate about Italian food.Mmm.  Mmm-mmm. [shakes head ‘no’][Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.Where’d he go?Mose, Angela hasn’t been around here much lately, has she?Angela – she used to stay here sometimes?Okay, we’re watching, Mose!",
    "Micahel": "So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.",
    "Jan": "You do.Well, they both go with the carpet I’ve ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.A futon’s not a sofa.I know what a futon is, Michael.It costs what it costs.We have gone through this.Conniving little runt. Put him through.So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.Why? Improv? Why don’t you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?You drive, I had too much wine.I didn’t go.I just didn’t!How was improv?[on phone] You’re broke?[on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don’t, I don’t get this.  I really don’t.  I don’t know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don’t know what more to say.[on phone] Yeah, what?[on phone] Okay, where did he go?[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?[on phone] I’ll be right there.Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]Michael.What’s going on?Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?What does that mean?Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won’t solve anything.  You know that.Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It’s not that bad.Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn’t have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won’t even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That’s just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I’m going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where’s this train taking us?I’m keeping them. I know you like them. They’re kind of uncomfortable though.It’s kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.I just think that…Why?I think you can.  I… what?All right, well then maybe there’s another way, you know?  I mean, we could just… we’ll think of something else.Well… well, we will.We just will.I have some ideas.[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.Oh, yes, you will.",

    "Ryan": "[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.Hold on, I’ll get them on the phone.Hey guys! What’s happening? How’s my favorite branch doin’?Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?You didn’t prepare a presentation at all, did you?I’m your boss.You have another job?You can not have another job if it affects your work here.It did, all ready.Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.It’s not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn’t information you need.How long until you actually get this presentation ready?You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.What?No, it’s whomever.Do you really know which one is correct?As an object.Wait! This doesn’t matter. And I don’t even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you’re fired here.",
    "Jim": "[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.Hey Dwight.Do you run the bed and breakfest?Does the Department of Health know about this?Uh, Michael.That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.Darn it!No, can’t.Where are you going out tonight?I wouldn’t understand or a secret?I can’t believe this place is real. I mean, I’ve heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.The Beets Motel? That is, wow.How are you doing this?Nice.Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.Not even Harry Potter?Hmmm, I’d say 1 in 6.Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.You know, I’ve just realized, this is Pam’s and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine… uh but, wine that wasn’t made out of beets. Didn’t think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just… less.[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you’re going up there?Hey Dwight.Does Mose have nightmares?Oh yes. Ever since the storm.Yeah, yeah.Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]You okay?Are you a cocktail waitress?No, sometimes its right.Dwight, how’s the hotel business?Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?Maybe you should.The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.You will never want to leave your room.Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?Yeah, I didn’t think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn’t take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.Ah, dinner.  Let’s see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.Yeah?Okay.Yep, I’m very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I’m in love with Italian food.Right back at ya.Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.Pam!  You don’t think he’ll mind if we take the shampoo, do you?

    "Dwight": "[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I’m sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don’t conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!None of your business, Jim.It is not a B and B.Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.I’m not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.Where did you read that?Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That’s what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you’ll ever see.How many in your party?We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you’ll be interested in, um, Mose’s table making demonstration?One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.You took that with you.You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn’t see it there.My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don’t care, they’re your oats.We have three rooms, each with a different theme.American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.I’ll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?No.No. Jim, come on.Mose, bags! Now!Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I’ll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we’ll get that power back on. All righty.Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the— Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow![reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort’s surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. “Harry?” It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.[Jim knocks on Dwight’s door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.Is everything satisfactory with your stay?Great.Oh. Well I’ll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.Pam.I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]Stupid.No.Maybe you should.

Unless you mean gonorrhea.Yes, I did, ‘cept I don’t think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she’s in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.
