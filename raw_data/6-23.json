    "Toby": "This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting ’em everywhere. And… please don’t throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael’s face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don’t throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.Come on, Michael. You’re interrupting.Please sit down.I don’t wanna do this.[walks in] Hey everyone.",
    "Michael": "Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I’d rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time… I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time… I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]Pfffffttt.You’re kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?You know what? We’re not gonna die of radon, we’re gonna die of boredom.Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.Okay, alright.I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.Okay geniuses, how would you do it?I don’t know.Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!Good work. [clapping][walks in] Morning everyone.Hello!Oh, thank you. It’s reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles’ flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That’s my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?Okay. Well… that’s random. I will dig into those later.No, I gotta go. Text me later.Hey.Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.That… exists?Okay, well, I’ll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.Okay, Pam… she’s not invisible so stop asking silly questions.Since when is this an office where we delve into each other’s personal lives?I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband… or you took a random poll, yeah, it’s wrong.Well, I think we all know what you’re capable of Meredith.People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.I’m sorry, it… why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat…On her diet! He’s a sports guy. He’s scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.Real sports with Bryant Gumble.You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he’s an angel? I don’t think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.I am Beyonce always.Yes, I am.I would love that.I have work to do.Let’s go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can’t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he’s making me do to her.All right, Andy, please.Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That’s him. That’s him.Right there. The coach!Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?All right. Can you just– can you just act normal for a second, please?You have no idea what you’re talking about.You don’t. No, no.You don’t know. You don’t– you don’t know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn’t even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it’s like, “Hey, Donna, why don’t you wash the dishes?” “High-five, Donna.” “Hey, why don’t you bring me my slippers?” “Hi-five. I’m taking all the credit.”Okay, well, that’s because he’s paying their salary.I know, I know, I know. It–I’m–it– that was a euphemism.Shh! Okay, all right. Don’t, don’t.[whispers] Okay.No. God. You go talk to him.No, no, no.I’m good. Oh, my God.Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart’s still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, “I’m sleeping with your wife.” And you know who does that? James freakin’ Bond.Okay, orange slices. There ya go.Don’t thank me. Thank Dylan’s mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!You love it. There ya go.Uh, no, they didn’t say team. They just said coal Hawks.Well, then it wouldn’t be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.I did.No. We just talked. He’s very nice.It did not.Isn’t it?I’m awful, aren’t I?I’m an awful guy! Ooh!I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I’m hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.I don’t care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That’s Lemon.You’ll learn, baby. You’ll learn.Yeah, I noticed that.Nope.I have got big balls.Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at– [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that’s… [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I’m sick of this. I’m sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that’s going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we’re into isn’t very condo-appropriate.Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes][driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I’m a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what’s right. And it was either living with myself or… being happy. And I picked… the… former.Yes?[sighs] Umm… I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to… the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.Oh. Okay. I was talking about… what do– what? What’s going on?",
    "Everyone": "YEAH! [laughter]No. No!Mm-mm.Yeah, that works. That works!Hey! [applauses] Hey, hey!",
    "Jim": "That’s… not okay.Stanley, please, this is serious!So we’re gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?Exactly. It happened in Big.I’m really too tired to do this.Then let’s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?We can order in from Hooters.Billy Joel Rock Band.Now you’re just being hurtful.Pam.Yeah, well it’s really warm in here. It’s like a sleeping bag.Sorry about that.Well, you were surprisingly restrained.Excellent. Go for it.Right? So, uh, let’s uh…Now, were those for the team?Ah.[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?Well, it doesn’t mean I can’t drink it.A place?Okay.",
    "Dwight": "You were being really funny, and then you went too far.No, hmmm… that’s still…Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here’s how you do it:You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you’re Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you’re Toby. Andy, you’re Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis’ throat, then Toby’s, and finally Andy’s]Leave, get outta here.Right now!Michael, nice tie or something.No.Alleged contract.Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don’t even need to make contact. The law will do it.So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point “B”, uh… the beet juice cleanse?How do we know this? I’d like to see a stool sample.Eughh. [looks disgusted]Same page. Just keep moving.Which we can’t know.Unless we’re unplugged.And wake up in the future.What?What?I don’t have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don’t want to dig past a certain someone to get it.$30,000? There’s gotta be another way.Look, I will not pay.“Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?”Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.But not in your bed. It’s lumpy.Fine. Five times. [signs contract]No.Do you understand how rare is that in nature?[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don’t have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they’re no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let’s see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!I could have stopped him.Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]Never mind. Just never mind.Oh, it’ll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It’s not in the contract.",
    "Creed": "Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we’re out of paper.Are you gonna add any more?He don’t give an “F” about nothin’!",
    "Oscar": "All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden…Why would you throw something wet at me?How can you live with yourself?",
    "Ryan": "Is there a curtain rod in the room?Okay.I don’t know why you were in that part of the bookstore.All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, “I read a book about anthropology.”I’m not scream– I’m not screaming.Good for you, man. Good for you.He takes what he wants.You know what? I think you’re attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.You read my mind.Yep.It’s hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don’t know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can’t be that cold.",
    "Stanley": "How about make-believe land has anything you want?Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody’s spoken their mind, and no one’s changing their mind.",
    "Angela": "Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there’s no evidence?No.Rather than spend all day in court, we’ve decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.Alleged? I’m going to own your farm by the time this is over.I’m doing it. You know I am. It’s disgusting.Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]Same page. Go to the next one.What?He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.I want eye contact.Yes.I’m not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]No.What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]Well, it better work.",
    "Pam": "What flavors did you get? [yawns][reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?No, no, no, it’s fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open ’em up.Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we’re just trying to get out in front of this.[yawns] Yeah, or no… well… I don’t know. I’m sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I’d be running this.And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get’s like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don’t know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.No, out! Get out now! Leave now.Leave!Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?That’s awesome. You want some ice cream?Could he still be seeing her?Me too!Hey Michael.We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.Yes.[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.You were supposed to be the Lookout.So embarrassing.We will be well-rested tomorrow.I don’t think those were yours to take.Did you talk to him?You talked to the man whose wife you’re having an affair with.I don’t think I’m gonna make it.[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.Well, it does and it doesn’t.You sleep in the warehouse?Okay.",
    "Erin": "It’s so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.Do you want me to go back to the store?This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That’s what Pam told me.That’s okay. You probably shouldn’t keep a baby up that late, though.We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.He’s coming.Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]Thanks, Michael.What about Kelly?[quietly] Is this a joke?",
    "Kevin": "That’s hilarious.Boi-oi-oi-ingWow. That is crazy.Yeah. That’s pretty bad.That is a dangerous game, friendo.Why not your condo?",
    "Lawyer": "I don’t follow this exactly. Uh, “The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have…”Are we talking about your grandchildren?Finally there’s a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix–This is essentially…Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.Look, I can’t enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.Look, I don’t think that’s actually legal.Look, I can’t legally watch this unfold. It’s coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.",
    "Dwight and Angela": "Joint custody",
    "Andy": "No secret crying. Hasn’t even opened the tissue box in there.Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.How does he feel about it?Did Donna tell you that?So you’re just making a giant assumption. You don’t even know the guy.My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I’ve lived the part. And let me tell you, I’d so much rather play the part on stage.So… here’s the thing about infidelity.How does that work?In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You’re Ali Larter, I’m Beyonce.Not this time.This guy’s a high school baseball coach, right? Let’s go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let’s go check it out.Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bumBaseball!Where?Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees![announcer’s voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.Whatever. I’m the one blending in.Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.I know it’s like cricket.And it’s–there’s– well, home plate is like a wicket.Seems pretty well liked by the team.You do know that high school coaches don’t pay their players.Great game, coach.You guys are awesome! Best game I’ve ever seen in my life.Ha. The other guys can go die.Baseball! Go talk to him.Shane. Great game man!No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.Ha. No. No. But we’re gay for baseball. [chuckles]But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.I mean, isn’t marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let’s round you out as a person.I get it, man. I love it. That’s what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.Of course.But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!Come on, get over here.Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.Do you want someone to stop you? ‘Cause no one’s going to.",
    "Phyllis": "I don’t think he’d do that.Oh Michael.Hey!Was there a fistfight?And it didn’t change your mind.Michael, that’s awful.Yes.For your signature. [drops document on Michael’s desk]",
    "Meredith": "That is something I would never do.Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.I ask… everyone in the room, “Are you in a relationship?”.",
    "Kelly": "Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.‘Cause it’s next to they baby section, okay?I don’t really know why you’re screaming at me right now.That’s Meredith’s cake. It’s her birthday.",
    "Gabe": "[ahem][Pam snores] Guys?Can you two please join me in my office? Now.I don’t wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.Okay. That’s great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.I’m sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?",
    "Shane": "Yeah, right. You must be rootin’ for the other guys.Let’s go.Do I know you?Are you somebody’s… parents? Oh, are you guys… Kenny’s dads?Okay.Okay. Let’s go!Whoa!Hey, I’m really sorry, I’m just trying to… focus here on the game.Of course. Okay? I gotta… get back to this.All right.It’s all right. It’s all right. Keep it going.",
    "Darryl": "Probably shouldn’t tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so… we have a place.A restful location. Talk to Glen. He’ll take you up in the lift.Lightbulb’s burnt out, so it’s dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I’m trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn’t exist, okay?Pam.",
    "Reporter": "Michael Scott?Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?I’m talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire."
