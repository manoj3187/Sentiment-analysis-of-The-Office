    "Dwight": "Michael!?I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?I, but if there were, I’d be protected as assistant regional manager?Yeah, so I don’t have to worry?Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?It’s a real shame, ’cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.I didn’t do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for… maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What’s the scuttlebutt?Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. ‘Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who’s vulnerable and who’s protected…Did you get your tickets?The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]There’s one other thing and this is important. Let’s keep this alliance totally a secret. Don’t tell anyone.Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the… paper products?Did you tell Pam about the alliance?Just now.Right, that’s good, good, pursue this.Mmm hmm.Done.They seem awfully chummy, don’t you think?Only one way to find out.What? I believe it.I could tell, from the body language.Good, let ’em. It helps our cause.Oh, they’re forming an allianceDamn it. God!God… Damn it! Why us?Jackpot.Hey, you wanted to see me?I don’t think she’d be missed.Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.She had a hysterectomy.That’s where they remove the uterus.It could be kind of funny.Oh my God, we have to be there.No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.I know. I know exactly what to do.I’m a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are… at vision.This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.So tape it down.Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I’ll poke holes in the box.No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don’t notice we’re both gone.Can I trust Jim? I don’t know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don’t. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.[box falls over] Oh.I have absolutely no idea.Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That’s the game. Convince him we’re in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.[With blonde hair] That’s politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",
    "Michael": "Oh! God. Dwight, come on…There’s no downsizing.Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn’t guarantee it if there’s downsizing, okay?But there’s no downsizing, so just don’t…Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.It looks like there’s gonna be downsizing. And it’s part of my job, but… blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, “You’re fired.” [as Donald Trump] “You’re foir-ed. Uh, you’re foir-ed.” It just makes people sad, and an office can’t function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] “You’re foir-ed.”  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, “You’re hired, and you can work here as long as you want.” But that’s unrealistic, so…Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam… Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is… drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?Who is it? Who’s the birthday?Next person on the……calendar.Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!Um… uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it’ll be a surprise.Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up![grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing ’80s party last year. Off the hook!So I was thinking, if you haven’t already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.She’s not the only one that’s going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It’s not, uh, it’s not just about her, so…Mint chocolate chip! That’d be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?[to the camera] Can you get her? She’s right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this… is Meredith’s card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let’s see. Jim, Jim wrote, “Meredith, I heard you’re turning 46, but, come on, you’re an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.” Not bad, pretty funny, I don’t appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here’s the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I’ve already set the bar really high. And they’re all worried about their jobs, you know. It’s kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, “Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You’re great. Love, Michael.” [pretends to vomit and laughs][staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith… Meri… Mary had a little lamb. Mary… Meredith had a little lamb. Don’t bring that lamb to work or it’ll poop on the floor.Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What’s up?Oh, not at all. Come on in. What’s going on?What?Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.No, I’m always good… for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you… $25.Oh, my gosh, well… Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into… morale. That’s what I say, so…[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.[laughs] Which one is that again?Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just… OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I’ll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let’s go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.It’s surprise Meredith. One, two…Find a key.And many more!You were surprised, weren’t you?You looked freaked, man. We said “Surprise.” You were, like, “What?” “What the hell’s goin’ on here?” Good cake. Why don’t you have some?Come on. A little bit.Oh, right. God, too bad. It’s so good.You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I’d kill myself. ‘Cause this is way, way too good.Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.Well, you know, money isn’t everything Jim. It’s not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you’ll give more than three dollars next time.Is Oscar around?I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know… 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn’t think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so…I know…Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um…No, no, no, no, no. That wasn’t what I wasn’t, that wasn’t… No. It-it-it’s not about the money. It’s just… it… it’s the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How’s your nephew? Is he in good shape?How many miles did he do last year?Son of a bitch. That is impressive.Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.[under his breath] I don’t know about that.[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.[laughs] You didn’t get the joke. So, that’s cool. That’s, you know what? Actually… I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn’t use. Um… Oh, where’s that? Oh, OK, here’s a good one. Um… “Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.” ‘Cause Meredith’s been divorced like, twice. Is that right?Divorce. Um… OK, “Meredith is so old…”Everybody? If… could do it? “Meredith is so old…”“She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”That wasn’t even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don’t get mad at me.This isn’t my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.OK, we… all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we’re losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are… a group of people… who work together. I was… I really wasn’t gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar’s nephew’s… walkathon. $25.Per mile, yes.When I retire, I… don’t want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.A check for the kids, and for the team.I want it to be like… “Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?” “Um, well, I don’t, I don’t know. It was anonymous.” “Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.”  “But it was anonymous, how do you know?” “Because I’m him.”Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don’t cash that till Friday, OK?",
    "Stanley": "Why’d you do this?Last year, five years ago…",
    "Pam": "Um… Actually, we don’t have any staff birthdays coming up.Oh.Okay, umm… that would be Meredith.But it’s not until next month.You still want to have a party?How about green?This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn’t like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn’t smack her.It is… her birthday.An alliance?What does that even mean?[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?Um, I don’t know, I’m just like, I’m going a little crazy ’cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?Yeah, he’s making me take notes on these meetings and I’m, like, “These people are my friends.” But he’s all like, “This is confidential. You can’t tell anybody.” But I just feel like I want to… aaah. Just promise me you’re not gonna say anything.OK, yeah.He’s in a box?[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don’t know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that…Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]Oh, tell me, tell me.[laughing] That’s perfect!Hey, Hey!Come on.It’s just office pranks.",
    "Phyllis": "Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could… it’s stupid, forget it.I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that’s dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.Yeah?Well, there’s green, um, blue… yellow… red…Oh, boy… You…",
    "Angela": "What?No, yeah, I think that’s a good idea.What color do you guys think?I think green is kind of whoreish.Meredith’s allergic to dairy, so…No, it’s ah…Phyllis wanted red, I didn’t.",
    "Jim": "Absolutely, I do.At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.To what?And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says “No, Jim, here’s a way.”Oh yeah.I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I’m not sure.Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.What? No.What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I’m using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.Well I’m trying to. Do you see what I’m doing?But listen, I’m going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.All right.Yeah, what do you think that’s about?I’m on it.You are not going to believe this.Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone…Toby and Kevin, they’re trying to get Angela kicked off.Well, I don’t know, if Kevin’s in accounting, and Toby’s in Human Resources and they’re talking…I love their sandwiches too.Their bread is very good.OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.Because we’re strong, Dwight. Because we’re strong.Sure, what’s up?Oh no?No, will not, I’m not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.OK, here’s the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith’s birthday.I know, but it’s gonna be a little tough because there’s no good place to hide there.What? What?[gives Dwight a high five] Great.Good.Wait, this isn’t gonna work. The lid’s open.I can’t do that. You won’t be able to breathe.Thank you, thank you. OK.So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?Right… That’s good.Pam, he’s in a box. He’s downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I’m serious. Go down there and work your magic.Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar’s charity. What was it? 25 bucks?Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It’s gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So… God, I can’t even calculate what you’re gonna have to give.OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and… [Pam starts laughing]… spy on our other branch. No no no.But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.If we can get him to drive to Connecticut… and put peroxide in his hair…No, no, dude, no.No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.God, I don’t even, I don’t even know how to explain this. Uh, um… Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um… um… we were… we’ve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um…It’s stupid. It’s, it’s just office pranks.",
    "Kevin": "Italian.Yeah.Their bread’s really good.",
    "Toby": "I love their sandwiches.Really? Today?Oh, Happy Birthday.Yeah, I could say something.",
    "Oscar": "Uh, I’m sorry to bother you.My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to… you know… if…Donate to the charity?Thank you.That’s… that’s… that’s very generous.Well, that’s what a walk-a-thon is.It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, “However many dollars per mile.”I just think it’s kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.Yeah.Last year, he walked 18 miles.How old is she?Uh, nice party Michael.Per mile.Thank you, Michael.",
    "Ryan": "Michael? Are you done yet?Yeah.Thanks.No, don’t. Don’t do that.",
    "Everybody": "Surprise![tunelessly] Happy birthday to you.Happy birthday…[singing] … birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you…How old is she?",
    "Meredith": "Oh! Surprise.Yes.Uh, I can’t. Um…I can’t eat dairy.Yeah, it makes me sick.“Happy Bird-day” Um… “Meredith, good news. You’re not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.”That was Stanley. “Meredith, happy birthday, you’re the best. Love, Pam.”This is from Michael. “Meredith, let’s hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.”No, I… I get it. It’s funny.You’re right. You’re right. Yes.",
    "Roy": "[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?Come on."
