    "Andy": "You wanted to see me?Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy’s a wittle scared.Why would people say that?Andy have a boo-boo tummy.Would you rather me say “Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?”“Crazy diarrhea happening right now?”  Cause things can get real adult real fast.Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy’s sowwy.Well if I we’re complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.I don’t-just people.  For the record, I think it’s pretty fantastic.[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!Don’t worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I’ve worked has had one.Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.Great! [sits down]Nope! [stands up and leaves]Jim’s talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.Correction.  It was my idea.That would be employee number three, which would be… son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.Oh, really? From what, two to four?",
    "Michael": "Yeah, Have a seat.Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?Mmm-hmm.Okay.You are also on record as saying “wittle-ittle,” “footy-wutties,” “nummies,” “jammies,” “make boom-boom,” “widiculous,” and “wode iwand.”You can’t be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.Okay, who said that?[Elvis voice] Well, thank you… thank you a lot.  And for what it’s worth I think your baby voice is tops.[as Elvis] You’re welcome, baby.Keep.I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.Keep.For what?Oh okay.  I don’t know how those got on there…Must be hackers.What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?Worse than that.Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.Is that what we’re going for now?  “okay?”  We used to go for “pretty good.”Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I’m not in this for the trophies, but…Well, technically, I’m a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.It would look good, on my mantle.There you are.  I don’t think we have finished with my Inbox.To change lives.Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can’t go through with this.Well…No.I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn’t want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I’ve made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?I’m not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I’d pay for college.  Okay, all right.Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of… [makes yuck face at Erin]Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?Good to see you.  Where’s your saxaphone?Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.Well, you didn’t even hear it.Oh, good.Sure.Oh, yeah.No, not at all.  Nope, come on.Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn’t go in there.  I’m pretty busy, I should just…Oh.Wow![crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don’t think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between “A” gym and “B” gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I’ve done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what’s invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what’s gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you’re going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and… I’m sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody’s tuition.  I’m so, so sorry.I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.I lied to myself too.  I’m not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn’t even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don’t know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can’t pay for your college.  But you don’t have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They’re lithium.Erin, can you give us a second?Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I’m sorry.What can I do?I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?Really? Wow.  That’s over $200 a year.For-okay, okay here’s what I’m gonna do.  I’m going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I’m going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I’ve got monies to move around.That’s a lot of zeroes.Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.Yes.You’re what, like, 12?I think you’re doing a great job.What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn’t go out of business?Really?You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.Yeah.  I just sort’ve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.",
    "Jim": "Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?Wow, what do you put our chances at?Hmm, sounds risky.Wow, that’s not such a bad idea.Anything else?Hey.  What’s up?Did you murder someone?I think she’s okay.Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?You’re not in it at all, because you can’t be employee of the month, you’re a manager.It would look bad.  Sorry.Not much.[laughs] Thanks Dwight.You’re creeping me out.  I’m gonna go.Let me guess, you think you should get it.Well, in an ideal world…Okay, if it’s all the same to you, I’m just going to take away “Survival Skills” and “Self-defense.”That’s okay, I’ll do it.Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you’re all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?Okay, wait, I was not… I did not-Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could’ve given it to myself because I didn’t even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I’m not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we’ll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.Dwight?No, Dwight, I meant… Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.Okay.Guys, this isn’t some elaborate scam, okay?Okay.  That is me, but I didn’t order the cake.This is Jim.Hey, uh David.So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It’s been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.No.I really don’t know how it happened, David.All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.Yeah.  Thank you.Yes.See you.See you tomorrow, Dwight.",
    "Erin": "Frankie’s Dirty Joke of the Day?  There’s a bunch of those.There’s a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say “Delivered.”  Should I delete all of those?That’s why you have a “Sent Mail” folder.There’s about 30 news alerts for “Nip Slip.”“Nip slip.”Well…Oh, my God.Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn’t.We’ve already rescheduled seven times.I can print out a new itinerary with Pam’s name on it.Wow![points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You’re famous.Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do—No.No, there’s financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.The principal told me that 90% of Scott’s Tots are on track to graduate, and that’s 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn’t made that promise, a lot of them would’ve dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.Really?I’ve always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.Yes, but I’m terrible at math so…Seriously?",
    "Dwight": "Yeah!  Your idea.My idea.  I just need Andy to think it’s his idea.  So it won’t get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.Hey Jimmy, what’s up?Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.That laugh is so infectious.I didn’t mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don’t nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.I’m going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.You seem suprised.Hey buddy, so every-Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.Oh, no!Yeah, you said “In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.”  Isn’t that what you said?My idea!Excellent idea, Pam.There must be some reasonable explanation for this.He knew all along![imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?Tell him I’m mad at Jim, because he’s asking us to give money to Pam.[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.[imitating Toby] It’s Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.I know how it happened.[Dwight is listening to the recording-pen from Jim’s office]No!What?No.What?Oh, you’re kidding me!Damn it!Apparently.Not now, Temp.What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn’t even know how to begin a diabol… [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight’s daibolical plan]So what do you want?",
    "Pam": "[glances at it] Looks great.Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?Michael, why did you promise that?No Michael, why would you promise that?Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you’ve done.It’s terrible.Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it’s going to get.No!You have to tell them.It’s fine.  Erin, you’re going to go.  And you’re going to make sure Michael tells the truth.Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn’t Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we’ll move on.Thank you.No, wait, come on.  I didn’t miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.Yup.",
    "Phyllis": "What’s “Scott’s Tots?”Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.That’s fair.How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?",
    "Stanley": "Has it really been ten years?[shows newspaper article and reads] “Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders”",
    "Mikela": "Mr. Scott?I’m good.It’s in the music room, Mr. Scott.Everyone’s so excited that you’re here today.Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first?I’m sure you remember this place.Do you want to go in?We just want to say thanks.You lied to us.",
    "Students": "[cheering] Mr. Scott!  Mr. Scott!  Mr. Scott![getting up and dancing] Oh!  What?  Oh! Break it down!  Hey, Mr. Scott!  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!  Hey, Mr. Scott!  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!  Hey, Mr. Scott!  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!Hey, Mr. Scott!  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do, make our dreams come true![yelling]",
    "Teacher": "Mr. Scott, I know you’re a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot.  But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you.Politicians are always coming around, telling us they’re going to fix our schools, promising this and that.  But you, Mr. Scott, you are actually doing it.  You have taught these kids with hard work, that anything is possible.  You are a dream maker and I thank you!  I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you!  So much.Let’s put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott.Oh, no.  We’re okay.  It’s a double period",
    "Lefevre": "You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don’t need to compromise, cause we can have it all!  Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable!There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game.  But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me.  So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama.You owe this to us!Hey, Mr. Scott.That was messed up what you did.Who does something like that?  Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn’t come through like that?You can pay for my college.They’re expensive.It’s about $1,000.No, $1,000 each year.Okay. Okay.  Make it out to my mom, Rosa.",
    "Kevin": "Hey.Jim said that?Jim said that?No, no, that makes total sense.I… I… I did not… That was not… How come not?Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]",
    "Oscar": "Sure. [puts in the twenty]Are you kidding me?",
    "Everyone": "Huh?  What?",
    "Angela": "To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.Yes!“It could only be you!”  Way to go.",
    "Zion": "I’m Zion, I’m Mikela’s younger brother.",
    "Creed": "Guys, I’m starting to think Pam’s not really even pregnant.",
    "Deliveryman": "Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert.",
    "Kelly": "I’m going to have some cake.",
    "Stephanie": "David Wallace’s office.No, he’s in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?",
    "David Wallace": "Jim, what the hell is happening there?",
    "David": "Yes.Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?Am I missing something?Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can’t do that, we’re going to have a separate discussion.Uh, hey, I’m sorry.  I’m taking this out on you.It’s been crazy here.  You know I think you’re doing a great job, right?Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?Okay.",
    "Michael and Erin": "Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.",
    "Ryan": "How’s it going?  Good day?Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.I found a copy of it in the copier tray.I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in."
