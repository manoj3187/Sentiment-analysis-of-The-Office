Wow.Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.She looks older.No.Or a high school girl. Let’s go [mouths ‘wow’ to the camera].What’s that?Oh. You don’t have to tell me this.You shouldn’t be talking about that.Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.No, can’t help you now.No. D-Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.Okay, Andy, we need to go.

    "Dwight": "That’s a ridiculous question.Well that’s debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought—Bears do not— What is going on— What are you doing?!You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!Oh, that’s funny.

Pam, run a comb through your hair.First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.

How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No… you putsupervisor on the phone![whispering] Say you’re sorry times infinity……’cause there’s no comeback for that.I don’t believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.You’re right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.Final touch-ups.Yeah.I don’t know…[coughs]…to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].",
    "Pam": "[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.We’re having a press conference?Yes, I’ll be sure someone returns your call.  I’m so sorry.  Bye.It’s just the Scranton Times…You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.Yes.Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman’s touch.Cut.Cut.One day for what?OK.Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.",
    "Phyllis": "[on phone] I know, I know.  We’re all trying to get to the bottom of this.",
    "Stanley": "[on phone] I am upset.  Don’t I sound upset?",
    "Michael": "[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we’re going to recalling all of that paper.We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing…  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I’ve never been a fan.Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.Crisis Management Squad.Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?To save time, Jim.You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.Don’t worry, Kelly will be training you first.Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.I want you to bring a partner.No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who’s actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.No, no.  I need two men on this.  That’s what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.Here’s the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That’s what happened to O.J.I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.is your headline. “Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client.  Some companies still know how business is done.”  Okay?  Battle stations everybody, let’s go, go, go, go, go, go!OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.Mrs. Allen is our most important client… because every client is our most important client.  Even though she’s a pretty unimportant client, really.And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.So, let us consider this matter ended.I know, I know you’re angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.Well, we are extremely sorry.We… are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.The watermark… it’s a one time thing.OK…What… can I do, for you?Well… [exhales] OK, well…  Um, wasn’t really my fault.  The guys at the papermill—The guys at the papermill— No no no!the head of the company?!No, I’m a regional manager—No— my— OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!That’s insane.  We’ll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.Doesn’t matter.  Out please!Yeah, well I’m calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not…No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then… YouTube gets a hold of it…You’re right.  It will blow over.  But it’s not… going to take… a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael’s hair] OK, I think that’s good.“Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.”That’s how devoted I am to this job.I know.I understand that, Dwight.Do you think you’re taking it a little… literally, Dwight?  And now we’re wasting tape.  I’m gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?So I’ll know where—I’m asking Pam to do it, please.OK, ready?Five, four, three.  “There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn’t be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let’s not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember… it wasn’t me.  They’re trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.”That’s… they always give an ultimatum.Good, cut?Thought so too.The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don’t act fast, you will lose customers.With dissatisfied clients, it doesn’t matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you’re sorry. They’re like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I’m sorry, it will be twice as effective.So we’re good?I’m sorry.Okay.All right. We are infinitely sorry.You understand? You… you get this check.The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she’s not our customer anymore.Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you’d be the weirdos.Are we ready?Okay. Am I shiny?Okay. We good? Okay, that’s enough Aqua Net.[clears throat] Stop it.I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn’t even me. It’s so not fair that they want me to resign.",

    "Creed": "Here.Every week I’m supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn’t there.  And I’m trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn’t there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did… when I was a homeless man.When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.Now I’m told she told her manager she had the flu.  I’m a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you’d like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She’s got some children.I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I’d pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It’s tragic.  Just tragic.[hums]Hey!I am indeed. How’d you know that?Oh, oh that’s right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I’ve been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She’s a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.Just doing my job, guys.",

    "Angela": "Kelly’s training us?[getting a pill from the bottle] I don’t have a headache.  I’m just preparing.Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don’t see how that’s our fault.  And I’ve already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don’t know what you want from me. [hangs up][on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That’s nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He’s upset about the watermark.[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.And you already got your money back……and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette’s or something!Kevin, what’s four plus seven?Yeah, well you didn’t know that when you filled out this payroll form.You two are apes.I’m sorry… that you’re both morons.I called you morons.Mm-hm.Alright, I think I’m trained.Why am I getting all of the bad ones?I’m not gonna lie and say I’m sorry when the company didn’t do anything wrong. That’s immoral, and this is ridiculous.What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you’re a slut and everyone thinks so.Gladly. I quit.Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn’t called you stupid.No, but some of your outfits are not appr-I didn’t apologize.We’re not.Don’t!Fine.Kelly’s not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].",
    "Kelly": "This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  Thisis bananas!  B-A-N-A-Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you’re not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]I know, right?  Probably a lot.OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say “Customer Service, this is Kelly!”  Except don’t say “Kelly,” say your own name.  Or if you’re bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation![in accent] Absolutely![in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doinggood.  Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?Ask where he’s from.OK, great.

Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I’ll be thinking about you all day.Customer service isn’t like accounting. It’s not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don’t like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you’re sorry. Do that and you’ll be fine. Make sense?Okay, role-playing time!Why can’t you just say you’re sorry and make them feel better?Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you’re old enough to be my mother.Well, you’re fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.Hey, Angela. I’m sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don’t know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it’s no excuse. So, I’m very sorry.Do you think I’m a slut?Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]We’re like best friends now!I’ll text you!Bye, Angela!That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she’ll be less of a grump.",
