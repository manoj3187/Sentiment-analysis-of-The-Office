    "Jim": "[Sighs] I’m having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.Well, yeah, but I’m wondering if it’s too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I’d get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don’t know the end of the word “Philadelphia”?Yes! That, that, that! We’re definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?Done, right?I’m not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?Right.[In Kitchen] We’re thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.Whoo!Yeah, I think so.Uh–Best Christmas ever.Thank you.Can’t wait.I don’t know. Is it what you expected?So happy right now.[Jim and Pam get up and run out into The Office]Yes, he is finally nigh.So he’s kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.Wow! It’s my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.Oh, it’s like naughty or nice.Quick question–Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?Oh, nice. Did you check that list?But more than once? ’cause you could have made a mistake.Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you’re gonna find out who’s–Damn.Ooh.Oh, you know what? I gotta go.Yeah, it’s all right.I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.Yeah, I know, I’d just like to settle in and get a good night’s sleep.Ooh.That’s right.Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.You know what? Yeah. Have at it.Ooh! Are you nuts?Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn’t hit anybody that hard.Just–Just–Hey![Dwight hits him again][As he’s walking out] That’s enough, I’m done! Okay? Agh!Aah! Ow![In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh…what was that? Now I’m gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh…I’m probably never gonna see you again.Okay, sorry, sorry.Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.I’ll call you when I get in.All right.Love you.[Jim gets in taxi and it drives away][Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.What’s going on? Where’s the belsnickel?What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]And I found out that there’s a bus at 5:00 a.m.[All cheering and chanting as Jim and Dwight try and break the pig rib]Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where’s Andy?Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They’re gonna bring you in for an interview.Right?Hey, of course.Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]Go get ’em.",
    "Pam": "I’m sure it’s fine. it’s a blue shirt.I’m on it.We’re the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight’s party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it’s not. Maybe it’s going to be great. And if it’s great…I think we all know what that would mean to us.Yes! Phyllis!What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we’re all going to do Dwight’s Christmas.Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.And that is…That there are no rules.You’re welcome.What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don’t touch it.Oh!I feel like [Pam look’s out the window and camera pans out in The Office]–Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.And the fear.Wow.[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.[While Dwight is decided on others, he puts canning jars in Angela’s bowl, and a twig in Stanley’s, then a normal talking head]Oh, really? Already?Well…this is it.Shut up. I’m trying to be serious.I can’t believe this is actually happening.Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You’re gonna be great.Okay.Love you.What’s going on?For what it’s worth, I liked your party better.I don’t think anyone thought that.Well, that didn’t have anything to do with you.Zero.Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?Jim!Oh–Oh my god![Pam goes to hug Jim, but Dwight runs and hugs Jim first]What happened? Did you miss your bus?",
    "Dwight": "Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don’t care about Jim’s new sports job in Phila-Whatever.Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning “Love,” and adelph, meaning “Adolf.” “the city that loves Adolf.” Good luck with your new enterprise and don’t wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.[Pam looks at Jim and nods her head in agreement]What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas’ rural German companion, Belsnickel.Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There’s me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn’t come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It’s a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!Uh-huh.Uh, Oh.You have never been cooler.[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody’s found the hog maw.What? It’s a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That’s a beauty, isn’t it? I don’t even want to tell you what it’s made of until after you try it.It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don’t even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd’s Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.Have you ever tasted a Shepherd’s Crook?[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.[Cackling] Ohh…[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!I am nigh!Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was…okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh…Too much strudel.No, much better–No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.Yes, exactly!No.Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight’s traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?Oh, come on. We don’t blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet][Nate starts walking towards the door, gets the text, and walks back to his car][Pete and Erin watching die hard on a computer]Take a bowl and pass it down.No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They’re a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.No, impish or admirable.I decided earlier.Of course I checked it.I checked it more than once.Impish or admirable.Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as…admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.It’s a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.You can’t have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]…as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick][Angela smiles smugly]No, I’m carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam’s bowl]In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren’t as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.[Kevin giggles as Dwight is poking him with a stick for being impish]Stop giggling.It’s a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?But you work tomorrow.But we were gonna break the pig rib.Remember?No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this–off with you!Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don’t you want to know your present?Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick][Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!They’re not abandoning the party. [Hit’s Jim again][Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]Party’s over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn’t real. It’s me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard][Everyone putting up normal Christmas decorations as Phyllis has a talking head]Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.Jim couldn’t even stay till the end of the party.I don’t care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.Damn It!No, thanks. I’ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.[Holds his finger to Jim’s lips] Shh. Let’s not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I’m gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim][Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.[Jim fist bumps Kevin and holds up the pig rib. Daryl sits in his office]Very impish.[Nellie and Toby back in the kitchen, Nellie looks bored and standing against the fridge. Toby walking around]",
    "Erin": "Oh…Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!I mean, it says “X-Mas party,” but I think we all know what that’s code for.Wait, German terrorists? That’s oddly specific. And I think–I think you mean John McCain.I haven’t seen it.Mm-Mmm.I don’t know, I just haven’t.No.None of this makes any sense to me![Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?Okay, let’s hear it.Die hard. Every line. Go.Don’t change the subject.Movie is starting.[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn’t the line. I’m sorry, Pete.I don’t know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin’s cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.[Reading the email from Andy] “What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.”[Erin walks back to Pete and sits down at the computer]So what comes next?We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.No. No more talking. It’s movie time.Oh, great. Great! So we’re watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.Mm. [Chuckles][Daryl drinking the gluhwein in his office, with some alcohol mixed in]Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?[Sliding away from Pete] I’m still Andy’s girlfriend.But you can leave your arm.[Pete puts his arm back around Erin as she slides closer to him][Back at the party, Angela sits on Kevin’s lap, everyone talking and enjoying the party]",
    "Angela": "No.Oh, right, like I’m responsible ’cause I’m in charge of the party planning committee.Don’t blame me for something we all forgot.No!No.No, no, no.[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.No. I don’t want my name attached to this party.Please just take my name off of everything.Huh.Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!",
    "Nellie": "Is It?Well, then, why don’t we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?Too weird.I’m sorry, the–Uh, the Scranton who?[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can’t, I mean, I understand.[Stanley gets up and leaves]Oh, it sounds like the party’s starting up out there.Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby’s lips]Shh.[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.No…more…talking.Yes. [Kisses Toby][Toby takes his glasses off and him and Nellie go against fridge and start to make out]",
    "Kevin": "So we’re not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?Well, you are the one in charge of it.Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?No.Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.“now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.”Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he’s like, “Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother–”Yes, you are right. Forgive me.Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]No, it’s not.I wish my car had a bathroom.[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?![Dwight walks in as Belsnickel]",
    "Oscar": "Yeah, let’s not blame her for something we all forgot.I didn’t realize how many of Angela’s opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.Just take her name off of everything.[Party Planning Committee walks out of The Conference Room]How would anyone even know–[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. “Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.”[Continues reading] “His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.”Ow! You hit people with that thing?",
    "Phyllis": "I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn’t. Hmm, funny how that works.We already said no.Let’s do it!Dwight said it’s “Hog maw.”It’s the lining of the stomach of–Come on, Dwight, you’re making this up.Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?I’d rather have the bowl.We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It’s like in it’s a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.[Kevin dressed up as Santa, helps Angela down from hanging lights]",
    "Meredith": "[Scoffs] We’re out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin’ our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!Topless Christmas.Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where’s the karaoke machine?Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in][Everyone groans. And in his office, Daryl continues to drink the gluhwein]",
    "Stanley": "No. I want Tropical Christmas.I love Philly. Dirty town.[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he’s walking by her] See you next Christmas.Ugh. I’m not eating mystery meat.Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.",
    "Creed": "Tapas swiss miss.Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa–What’s so hard to understand?",
    "Pete": "I’m just hoping German terrorists don’t take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.Die hard reference.You haven’t seen die hard?Why haven’t you seen die hard?“Come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs.”Actually, he doesn’t say that there. He says it earlier when he’s on the radio with Hans.Oh, that’s okay, bud.Common mistake.My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.Hear what?“You don’t like flying, do you?”No, that’s the–“Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that–”That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.Hey. Everything okay?Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] “After we call the police, they’ll waste hours trying to negotiate–”Or we can just sit and talk, though.I mean, are you sure…Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.Okay.Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn’t that crazy?Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what’s–Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?Oh, yeah, of course. I know.",
    "Darryl": "[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim’s shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?Think that through for a sec.Yeah, Jim’s going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven’t heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?What else could you possibly be forgetting?Things? People?[Jim chuckles nervously][Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy…what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It’s awful.Meredith’s a little cute. I’m just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.[Daryl comes out of the conference room and starts dancing. Meredith joins him][At Meredtith] Boo!I’m gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]You![Looking at Jim confused] That’s great.Thanks, man.I shall come by at your convenience.[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo![Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa![Everyone shouts alarmidly]",
    "Toby": "You know who’s not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he’s in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven’t I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?I–I could–I could talk about it.I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here’s the thing about moonlight. It’s not sunlight.Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.Two dimes, seven nickels–Well, okay, no, that doesn’t add up. It was one quarter and–What? I was just explaining–Why wouldn’t it–But why?Are you gonna kiss me?"
