    "Michael": "It’s 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan’s parents or Pam’s parents or my parents, you do.  They’re gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won’t do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.Milk and sugar.That’s what I said.Every morning.We’re, uh, we’re doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we’re having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20– of those.You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.Most do in the magazines.We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?They are correct, sir.Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.Lowest in town.Okay, sure. Right, so– why don’t you explain what that is to– so that they can under– just explain what that is.Explain that.Well, we don’t–Whatever, yeah.Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.Just crunch ’em.  Just crunch ’em please.Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I’m going to have to… ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we’re just going to need a much, much bigger check.Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It’s this.I would love that.Was it nice?I love Pad Thai.No.  There’s a lot I haven’t done.[knocking on door] Hmm?We’re not hiring, Jim.Listen, I can’t make you laugh right now.Jim, what you don’t understand is that this company’s worthl–No– We don’t have–[stammers] Uh… Yes.Yes, well, we’re not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.That’s a pun.Yep. Oh… wow.Of course not.Nope, nope, nope.Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we’re broke.Oh, I’m really worried that I’m going to say it.Ah…I’m good, I’m good.It is.  I’m good.Hello.Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we’re expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables…And we are prepared to reject that offer.Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don’t even want to hear what your first offer was.I’ll see your situation and I’ll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you’re going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don’t think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.[stutters] We’ll have to talk–Just amongst ourselves.Oh, my God. Oh, my God.We are so rich.No.It’s a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn’t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?Agreed?Shut up, shut up.  Hello?I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.And I want Charles gone.I need him gone.Okay, then I want Pam back.Sales.Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it’s heyday.And Ryan.You know, David.  I don’t care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.And dental this time.These are our demands.Our company is worth nothing.  That’s the difference between you and I.  Business isn’t about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.That’s one of ’em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.Can we have the room please?Yes! Can you believe it?  That’s what I’m talking about!There are certain defining moments in a person’s life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don’t even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.No, no. You’re done.",
    "Ryan": "We’ve been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I’ve gotten clean there’s something about fresh morning air that… just really makes me sick.Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.Most dorm rooms don’t even have that.Let’s see what a delivery guy costs.Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.Yeah.Explain what you think that is.I never went to Thailand.I went to Fort Lauderdale.Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.You’ve never had Pad Thai.Oh, that’s nice.He’s bluffing, Pam.Maybe.Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we’re broke.That we’re having any problem at all.No, man.  You’re– you’re fine.Just put it out of your mind.Michael, you  haven’t even heard–We’ll have to talk about this.How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.I would rather have $60,000, honestly.Yeah, discuss these things–Yes, yes, yes!",
    "Pam": "We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says “Alleluia Church of Scranton.” in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.You didn’t happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?Oh, awesome.  You’re a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?Do you drink this every day?[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It’s, uh, it’s a paper company now.  It’s not for the church.Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?Yeah, I know what a loft is.Corporate greed?Did it help?When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don’t blame the child.  He didn’t know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, “Drive, kid.  I trust you.”We have maybe a month.  I don’t know what I’m gonna do.That’s what Michael said.I like it.Steve Martin’s not dead, Michael.You want to hear something sad?So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding’s really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of ’em called me back.  Not even for an interview.Really?Seriously?  Are you being serious?Yes.Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.No, Michael.We have to come from a position of strength.Mm-hmm.$60,000.Are you kidding me?Can you give us another minute please?Michael.Why are you assuming you’d get the whole thing?No, Michael’s right.  Jobs are safer.Agreed.  But that’s all, okay.Thank you.That’s right.Alright!",
    "Charles": "Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they’re switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.I don’t want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.Why are you telling me this?Is this something you really want to have said?I don’t know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it’s my fault-I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh–Uh, well said, Angela.There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?Oh, you know it hasn’t been that bad.  Hasn’t been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn’t ask for a better way to learn a company.I feel like I should be thanking you.The conference room is ready if we want to get started.Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.Right.Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight’s been my guy.  Okay?Yeah, Jim–He shows promise and Jim, I don’t know– I– he’s been a disappointment.Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.God, no.I agree.Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?Yeah.We still have the inventory sitting– [everyone starts chattering at once]Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.What is wrong with you?No, Jim… I think you should go.What?Dwight.What?  How’d you hear that?So how long can they stay viable?Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?You two are morons.Get out.Oh, okay.They don’t make them anymore.That’s very kind of you to say, David.Hey, guys–",
    "Jim": "Oh, they’re my client.Hey, David.[makes kissing, puckering sound]Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?Really? Does he do good work or–[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.Oh, yeah, well don’t worry about it.  We’ll figure it out.  We’ll be okay.Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight’s voice saying “Idiot, Idiot, Idiot”] Oh, that’s my new “Dwight” ring.Good, right?  Hello.Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don’t worry about it.Now, this is the projection over three months?Oh, but you didn’t.Oh, I don’t know. You know, they’ve taken a good deal of clients, so–I mean I guess– I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.Okay, so I’ll be back in, um– back in a bit.Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?Actually here for something else.You know I love a good guessing game, but why don’t I just tell you what I’m here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.Oh!Oh!  See I’m here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.Missed the last part.Got it.Great work Dwight.No, I mean, great detective work.  ‘Cause this must be the first case you’ve ever cracked, right?What are your top five cases?Because you’ve solved zero cases.Got it.",
    "Dwight": "[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.It’s not your fault. Some people just don’t want to be inspired.Been there, done that.David Wallace! Hello, we’ve been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.Come along, afterthought.Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.I say we fill Michael’s office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]Five minutes exactly.Sure thing.[over phone] Idiot, we’re starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say– can I say something?There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That’s how you really apply the pressure.You know what?  Why don’t I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I’m the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you’re leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.They’ve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They’re desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They’re total failures.Quiet you.You don’t crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That’s like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I’ve solved plenty.I’m gonna answer Charles first.Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.Done.I’m not– I’m not following you.Wh–",
    "Stanley": "What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.",
    "Andy": "Hey, Boss. Uh, I’d just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.I don’t want to have said that.  But I think it’s important that you know it.",
    "Angela": "Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I’m putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.What do you hear?",
    "David Wallace": "Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.",
    "David": "A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I’m sure.Hmmm.Uh.You know, I just want to address everyone first.Hi, everyone.Hi.  Uh, look it’s no secret–Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I’m here– I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.Okay?I’ve been wondering that myself lately.  We’re just gonna get started, we’re gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?Hmm.I find that extraordinarily surprising.We’ll bring them both in.Fellas, why don’t we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.Yeah, yeah.I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but the cheapest option… is to make Michael an offer.Jim, you’re– you’re pretty close with him.  You think they’d be up for hearing an offer?Yeah.Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.$12,000.Here’s the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can’t be making very much money.  I don’t know how your prices are so low, but I know it can’t keep up that way.  I’m sure you’re scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you’re gonna get.Okay, now I don’t know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How’s about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.So you’ve thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?Yeah.I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.No.Uh, you already have a new receptionist–Pam’s not a salesperson.Okay.  Please continue.Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is–Do you realize what you’re asking for here?  You’re talking about salary plus health benefits–Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You’re talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.Your company cannot be worth that much.Michael–Okay.  Deal.  Okay?Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]",
    "Kelly": "Hi.[mumbles]",
    "Kevin": "Hi.",
    "Phyllis": "Maybe, and I don’t know, if you had just returned Michael’s call none of us would’ve lost clients.",
    "Financial Guy": "Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct–Then you can’t afford to pay him anything.Your prices are too low.Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can’t match your prices?Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that’s correct.But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.Okay.As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care……business expansion–At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you’ll make.They’re actually putting you out of business.",
