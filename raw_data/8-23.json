    "Gabe": "Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They’d flex them all night at the discotheque.Yeah.Core’s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate.I love the burn. The burn is where I live.Speed set. One. Two.Five. Six.We got it?Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.Did someone say girl talk?Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I’m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.Uh, I think you’re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It’ll be upsetting if you don’t.",
    "Dwight": "Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don’t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.Oh, I bet you think it’s all about core, huh?Oh, please.Feast on this, Lewis.Oh, thank you.Very funny Jim.I don’t need your help.Here, here… Just…Good, we have a deal?Thanks so much Earl.And they said it couldn’t be done. Boom!Yeah, and we’re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.And you are…Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.Yes.[pointing at Toby] There he is. That’s Lloyd.That’s true.Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could’ve choked so many people by now.Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim’s leg.Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.Don’t listen to him.Nope.Prestige is ours. Okay, they’re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.Make a decision.Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.Damn it!Wha – what is this supposed to be?Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.What?It’s him! Do something! Get out!Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That’s it? Oh, that’s great. That’s like a five second delay.Come on, let’s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.Yeah.Hit the nos.Yes.Got it. Go.Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together][Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!Just run! Take the stairs!I’ll stall him. Go!I’m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We’ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.My pants fell down! I don’t have a belt![walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.Well –I was here first.I already made an appointment… with your secretary.Wait, it’s not D.M Utica, is it?Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?No. Let him get his own. It’s Syracuse money.Jim couldn’t land me in a thousand years.Shut up.What?How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don’t even care about nationals.",
    "Jim": "Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who’s the strongest? Well, there’s only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.Come on, Gabe, you can’t handle his hamstrings. You’re getting hypno-thigh-zed.Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.You’re welcome.Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,All right, easy there, grandpa.Okay. You don’t need my help?All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.Thanks Janet.Wow, simultaneous sale.Screw ‘em.Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.Hey, hey, come on, language.In the fridge.Sorry, man, I can’t focus on zingers. There’s too many potential clients.Robert?The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]There’s actually not a rule that says that.How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?[Gets up and looks out Nellie’s office window] He’s running!Damn it.It’s a monkey.Hold on, hold on. Is this him?Is that him?What? What am I gonna do? I don’t –Dwight!Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.Are you sure?Brace yourself. 3… 2…1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]You all right?Ah! [Harry walks in][Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?What are you talking about?I don’t even know where the stairs are!God!What?Big Red Paper Company?All right, guys. It didn’t work out for any of us, so… we’re still on the same team. Let me get these.But you’re saying there’s a chance.Oh, man, I’d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?That sounds lovely.",
    "All": "Eight, nine, ten.",
    "Robert": "Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]Shh… shh… [vomits in trash can]Can everyone just, please… I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton?Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I’m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.Wonderful.Pam, when’s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn’t hold the memories in?Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.Yes, ‘course. Why don’t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.Let’s do it now. What’s number one?There we go.Where’s the Advil, Jim? I think I’ve hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh.Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?Oh, for god –Harry…How do you mean?Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There’s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems… so poorly timed.I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said… [Andy walks out]Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I’ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.Hmm.Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.Now we get to the bottom of Nellie’s “yes, yes, yes, yes, never.”Oh yes it can.Shopaholic.Yeah.Ah.Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.No, come on.Pam, Pam, you’ve completely bungled this![Erin opens door] Erin.Who is it?Yeah, hello?You’re blackmailing me.Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You’re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don’t even know my real name. I’m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]",
    "Andy": "Morning.Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot… these.You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.What’s this?Is this Robert’s attempt to embarrass me?Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they’re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it’s a little much? …Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that’s what it feels like.Lot going on guys. What’s happening?That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It’s like a festival of poo.Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.I forgot, a… a pan, uh –Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.No, I do not.Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.I’m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.No. I’m a rogue.Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now… [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.Of course they have. Which is why I’m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by.Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe… you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.Yes, yes, yes![in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don’t, and I will find another buyer.It’s just business.Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]You got a minute?I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.",
    "Erin": "Hey.Oh.Andy, if you’re gonna hang out for a while, uh…This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.No, of course not. It’s just – I think it’s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it’s like, where does it end? So just… [puts visitors tag on Andy]Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?There’s a call for you on line one.He says salvation. No last name.",
    "Stanley": "You two better watch yourselves.",
    "Phyllis": "Yeah, the Syracuse branch can’t be happy you’re taking New York clients.",
    "Oscar": "Why did Binghamton close?",
    "Kevin": "The branch closed. Forever.",
    "Nellie": "I got your voicemail. From – from last night.And the answer… is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]Oh. Oh, I’ll tell you what he does.Do you think I’d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?Oh!Oh, gosh.Thank you. I’m… so stupid.Oh, god, Pam. Don’t get me started.You’ve just got me started. Robert… is… a filthy beast. I mean, don’t you get the feeling, he’s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.Pam, what is your address? I’m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don’t –Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And… I have a new friend. A friend. At work.",
    "Pam": "Oh, it was this summer –Um, I am a little busy.Yeah, I can make you a list.Why don’t I help you now?Okay.[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in]So…what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?[Walks into conference room] Hey.I stole Nellie’s phone.What do you want from me?Sounds like it.Okay, that’s enough. [grabs phone]No, no, no!Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They’re all deleted.Ah. Ahh. [walks out]Hey.Um… yes. Definitely. With your hair –Certainly. Um… you dropped your cell phone.Yep.No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.No, I will not.Well –But sometimes he talks about flesh… and bacchanals.No… don’t. Just put it out of your mind.",
    "Harry": "Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.[shocked look from Jim]What the hell’s all this?You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one’s that guy?Where do you get off crossing state lines?They’re New York. We’re New York. State line is the dividing line. That’s the way it’s always been.Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?Stay out of my state. It’s in your best interest to stay out of my state.Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.Robert’s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don’t think we were doing that.Robert California. What a surprise you’re here in Scranton.So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.Listen, Robert, I don’t have time. There’s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions –Used to be Binghamton’s –I want it, it’s mine.We need you to make a decision.Is it just me or is our boss a freakin’ weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I’m gonna get some air.[Dwight jumping] What are you doing?Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse –Give me a cup of coffee.You know, your partner’s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?So what would you do if you weren’t selling paper?Nothing?I’d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like… a plane. One sale, I’m out.Anyway, Robert’s gonna run this company into the ground, so… We won’t be doing this in six months.",
    "Toby": "Me?Now, we’re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn’t back down from anybody. And he calls people “Kimosabe”.That’s true. There’s no rule. You can check the employee handbook.No.I’ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]",
    "Creed": "Yeah, you.",
    "Receptionist": "Oh, do you have an appointment?Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.He’s really not that busy.Yes, this man.",
    "Mr. Ramish": "Is there someone here to see me?Come on in. [Andy walks in]Why haven’t I heard of you? You got any references?Uh-huh.Every salesman I’ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.What’s going on?Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.Let me stop you all right here. I’ve already picked a new paper supplier.No, no, it’s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It’s… Big Red Paper Company.Mm-hmm.",
    "Angela": ": [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don’t worry, I won’t lay an egg.: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.",
    "Phone": "Hi, Nell, it’s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can’t be as bad as you described.This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?This is Annie from second nests. I’m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we’re gonna hold out for that.",
    "David": "[opens door] Andy Bernard.Um… I’m in the middle of a piano lesson.Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now… why would I want that? It’s worth half of what it was three years ago.Why don’t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]"
