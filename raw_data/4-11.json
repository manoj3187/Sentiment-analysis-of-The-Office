    "Pam": "What’s wrong Michael?You do.We have peanut butter in the kitchen.No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.You can’t, I locked the office from the inside when we left.There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, “What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?” He said, “If I’m dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.”I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?Aw! That’s great Toby.Toby, you’re the best.Phyllis.I know how to throw a football.Actually, it’s kind of too bad we’re not coming into work tomorrow.I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]That’s the other Boleyn girl.Shh.Mmm?I’m supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it’s part of my job.",
    "Michael": "I got gum in my hair.This just stinks. Don’t touch it, please don’t touch it.OK, let me be.I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley’s car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.Kill me… right now.I don’t feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we’re talking about.Smells good.Oh don’t. That’s disgusting.Well just don’t leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that’s nice.[sighs]I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude… that, but the women I’m getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren’t nice, or that have great personalities, they just… They just lack a certain… Crawfordness.Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or…Yeah.[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.Na?Well you tried.Yeah.They sound great.Would you have sex with Meredith?Do you think she’d keep it quiet?Jim, it’s not the horniness, ok it’s the loneliness that…Let’s go to New York. We’ll go clubbing with Ryan.Yes you can, you’re single, I’m single. It’ll be awesome.Who you dating?That’s still going on?Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we’re going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let’s go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.That’s… I, I think that…Ryan’s assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.Place is packed.Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.No, they’re just hotties.Hey.Hey!Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.Alright!Yeah.Ryan, it’s Michael and Dwight.Ok.Well.Alright!Let’s do it!Hey, nice to meet you.Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting “Back to the Future.”  “Back” because it’s on my back and “Future” because I’m the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it’s my second favorite movie.Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.Forty… I’m in my forties.Nuhh…Oh, OK.You are welcome.This place is like sexy pre-school.I would love a place where we could meet older.Ahh, wow. That’s dangerous.You’re kidding.I’ve never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.I am a bank teller.Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.I think so.Yeah, I have fun.All right.Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office – All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan]She washes dogs.I know. I don’t wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]Hmm…[on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I’ve asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They’re just, it’s not… [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.Well…Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club]Let’s go.I know, here we go.This is it.This is where the magic happens.Very nice.Dwight, I’m the boss.Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don’t wannna get my head stepped on.Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we’re going to take your clothes off.Shh, just stop. Here’s what you do. You tell him that you’re his friend and that you’re gonna help him and that everyone’s gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who’s selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who’s really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don’t understand a word of it.Best night ever.Like I said, it’s not about the horniness, it’s about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don’t, I disagree, I say… let’s hear it for the boys.You’re gonna be okay, it’s gonna…Ahh, ooh![helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on.Here we go, let’s sit down.All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You’ve got a great job, you… you can have any woman you want, you’re good looking, you, you know…Frien..sss…yes, you’re friends with a hobbit, and… look where you live.  I mean, you’ve got it all.No, I mean this apartment building, it’s fantastic.Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.Ryan?Do you ever miss us?Ryan?Do you remember what color my eyes are?Dwight, I asked him.Really?Not just because he said it?Ryan?",
    "Dwight": "You’ve got a ton of dandruff.Taste good too.Wow! Lot of calories.Hey Michael, how was your date last night?Question.Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?I don’t understand why our website has to have social networking at all.Yeah!No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.[laughs] With sex!Fire hazard.Women look like white slaves.Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.Do you live in a regular sized house?Good.Well it’s weevil season but we were prepared.They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.You’ve already been several times.Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.I’ll order you some cranberry juice.[to troy] Do you have powers?[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?Amazons.Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let’s go.OK. You know what, fine. Let’s go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let’s do it. C’mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let’s go, c’mon. Here we go.Wait, wait a minute, what’s this, I didn’t order this?Oh. [dumps drink out]It’s not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.I do, I have to go.No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I’m not gonna call her.Wow.All right.Nice.I got sofa. I got sofa.I got floor.[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?It’s a lullaby.I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.OK. Good night Ryan.Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.I am so sorry.  I’m so sorry, sir.That’ll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.It’s dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.Friends with a hobbit.Hazel.  They’re hazel.",
    "Jim": "How’d you get gum in your hair?But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.Nope. Not for you it’s for your hair, and it is 9 am.Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don’t know that a website’s going to be able to replace that.Thanks.Did I? I don’t…Hmm.Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.And then an older gentleman asked you “Boxers or briefs?”What?I’m gonna go to my desk.I know.I can’t.I’m not single.Pam.You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn’t have to come in at all tomorrow.So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas… the one time a year they hear one.Thanks a lot guys, Good job.Nice job everybody. Great work.Nope. I didn’t, but let’s go inside and I can call him right now.You really don’t have his phone number?Great, It’s under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or…It’s ringing.

Ah… Who, Who’ve I got here?[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he’s gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so… [everyone groans] we did it.Yup…[on phone] Please don’t pick up, please don’t pick up, please don’t pick up.Haaank. Is that you?Still haven’t left the house yet, huh?Good. Please hurry.Will do. [hangs up] I’ll stop calling.[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar.

[hangs up]  I’ll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]No, that was his wife, so he’s on his way.Well, he’ll be here really soon, Kev.Let’s be honest, it’s not totally my fault.

Phyllis?Yes, yes they did, yes they did.Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.It’s all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright?
