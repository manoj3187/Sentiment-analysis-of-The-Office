    "David Wallace": "…No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!",
    "Andy": "I resent that. I, I never lied to you.And all was good in Scranton PA that day.Oscar says “hi” all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. “Hi” “Hello” “Hola” You’re telling me you’ve never heard Oscar say “hi”?But you’re calling me a liar.By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you’ve been telling lately.Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] “Hey Andy, all’s well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife’s sick.” Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!This has been a really tough time.Yeah.Erin just dumped me and I can’t remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.It was like a security blan--ketYou’re not?That’s awesome.David, I’ll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I’ll be there for you. That’s a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.Crystal.Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.Good morning.And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed][Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don’t use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is…brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahhWhere are you going?Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?I’m still the boss!The answer is yes.Are they from you?Well then, I don’t want them. You can keep ’em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.Nope, I insist upon it. It’s an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.I don’t want to talk about work right now.Then I want my big blue sweater back.She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here’s the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.Survey says: ENH! Doesn’t make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.No.May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]Why doesn’t Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn’t she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.I’m not snooping, there’s just some crud on her screen.Uh, hello! Who’s snooping on who now?Everyone please, just-Oh my god.Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I’m psycho again. Uh, couldn’t shake this feeling that Erin’s dating someone so I looked at her phone.Too late. I found out she’s been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I’m just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia…from Erin. And it’s incurable. Pretty lame huh?I knew it!You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You’re fired!Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-..The camera don’t lie!You’re being an idiot get..Out of my office, turns out you’re fired…Because you suck.And you’re fired…So you had a bad day…Rut ti doh doh…Rut tit doh doh…Rut ti doh doo dohNo.Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.They already have a contract? [Reading] “Mutually agree to-” Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.Well, I’m not signing away my rights.Ok, well we’ll see about that. [crumples paper]Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.Ugh.That doesn’t matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don’t care if they’re Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet’s boss also had feelings.What?![wipes nose] Sorry.My whole life is a booger bubble!Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you’ve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don’t want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that’s fun.Hi.Hi, how’s it going?Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?Awkward.[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.It’s alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta “move on”. Ain’t that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How’s that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone’s day?Really? Hmm. That’s interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn’t be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.We’ll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.",
    "David": "Really? [reading from phone] “Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.”“By the way, Oscar says ‘hi’”Andy.Andy!Watch it Andy!My wife?Yeah?Has it?Shh.Andy.Shh. I’m not gonna fire you.No.I wouldn’t own the company if it wasn’t for you. So…I owe you that.We are even…now. Understand? Got it?You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.",
    "Erin": "Good morning.Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn’t know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete’s butt. It’s sick.I…..just have some messages for you.Well no, they’re from clients.I can’t. I-These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.Well I only want to talk about work right now.Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.Listen to him, Andy. He’s trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.See? We can all be friends!Just, get over it. It doesn’t have to be awkward.Hi.Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.Just keep walking, don’t give her anything. She’ll take it and run. I’m Erin by the way.Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I’m bad at small talk.What, do you two know each other?Oh.That’s so random.Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]So Andy just called you up out of the blue?Yeah.How are you doing? Is it really rough?Gabe!Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.I didn’t ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let’s-He didn’t even say that.Gabe, I don’t-What is that supposed to mean?I don’t want you to shave everything.What do you-!",
    "Pam": "He sounds like a wounded animal.Ok. [Andy continues moaning][taking paper from Kevin] Oh that’s mine! Um, I’ll just, I’ll get it out of the way for you.Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It’s um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I’m sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.Uh, not on a three month boat trip.[whispers] hello!Hi! Hey, do I look ok?Ok[pointing to Jim’s bluetooth headset] What’s that? Is that a-How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.Thanks.Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.Ha ha.Bye.Hello.Hi, Pam, hello.I’m Pam Halpert.Oh my god. He’s Michael Scott.[Mouths] Oh my god.Yeah, I’ve seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I’ve actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]So um-Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-Yes.Two children, yes.I am not pr-Pregnant, no.Wow.I’m sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.So, kinda like a receptionist.Yes.I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can’t.[on phone] hey!Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-Eight? Really?Sure. I mean, it’s Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I’ll see you at eight.Love you.Hello?Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn’t get the job.Oh, yeah. I’m more than alright. There’s just nothing to celebrate.[laughs] You’re very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.Guess what poster he had on his wall?MmMm.MmMm. You’re getting colder.[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.I don’t know, but it’s interesting right?He said he can’t help but tear up when he looks at it. It’s like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.Mmhm.I don’t know.I know. It’s just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don’t know, I don’t know if I want, um, I don’t know if I want this.Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.",
    "Stanley": "Should’ve put him out of his misery and just fired her.I’m the same way with horny people.Uh huh.That’s where nosey’ll get you.Why can’t you just do regular sit-ups?",
    "Phyllis": "I can’t be around sad people, it makes me sad.Andy, don’t. No good can come from snooping.Andy!What does that even mean?Put it down.Put it downSee?Told you so.Come on Andy, they’re a good match.Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?

    "Dwight": "[on phone] No, don’t just let her eat the grass, she’ll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I’m sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she’s your aunt too. Fine. I’ll see what I can do.[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.And you should take breaks more often, I’ve been waiting there for 45 minutes.It’s my aunt Shirley, she’s on her last legs.You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it’s all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by Aunt Shirley.Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.Thank you.Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she’s an old woman Angela. She needs a woman’s touch. It’s all hanging out-And there’s parts of her I don’t even recognize.There’s this one hanging part in particular, that’s some sort of flap.It’s like a prehensile wing or something, you know?It’s a divet…..where it was and it needs, it needs a…How dare you?Aunt Shirley, Hello! It’s me Dwight.This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!OKYou know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela’s gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?Ok.Yeah, trust me.It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.Now all it takes is half a liter. She’s dreaming. Alright, let’s get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.No, it’s a lot better than it sounds. There’s a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.It’s hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You’re gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.You’ll see. Here we go.Let’s do it! Ready? Here’s a box cutter to get her clothes off.Let’s get to it.Give it a whirl.I need you to hose my aunt.OK you are useless.Give me the hose!Ahh! OK!Yes ma’am.And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?Would you like the stink sack?No, you don’t eat it. It’s a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.Leave him. He probably won’t even notice that you’re gone. Be with me, Monkey.I’m not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life…I want to spend with you.Stand by your man. It’s what I would want if you were mine.",
    "Angela": "Ahh! Dwight!What? What is it?Dwight, that’s awful.What do you mean by “poisoned”?Ok, well I’m very sorry about your aunt.But I don’t see how this is my problem.Ugh.Gah.It’s fine.Ugh!

Now stay still.I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.There.You’re welcome. Would you like some stew?Mmhm.Is it any good?Thank you. [both laugh]Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.No, Dwight. The Senator.I can’t be your monkey, Dwight.I made a vow. I gave my word.Good night, D.",
    "Pete": "I’ve got the seat adjusted right.I was just leaving.I don’t know.

But you’ve gotta move on.Well, I’ve been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I’d run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We’re even Facebook friends now.Yeah.I do think we can have a fair….Alice. Oh man.Yeah. We uh, have a history.Well. Is it?Ok.Andy, that is really inappropriate.It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you’ve contrived.Yeah.No.It is so unpleasant. You?Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.It was college. That is what you do.She’s nice to me.Oh my god.Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.No!I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man.
