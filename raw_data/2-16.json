    "Pam": "I really like Valentine’s Day in this office. It’s kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight’s head on it, it was horrifying and funny and…[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.That’s OK.Guess what?That’s great. [Meredith scowls]OH, Holy God!You can’t fire me, Dwight, just ’cause Michael’s not here.You need to get something for your girlfriend.Tightly wound?Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.No, not like a ham. It’s about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.That you remember her.Yeah.[delivering plant to Oscar’s desk] Oscar.[walks away] Join the club.Hey.I guess, yeah.Nothing, it’s just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you’d get mefor Valentine’s Day.Heading out?Bye. [Jim leaves]Night Phyllis.",
    "Delivery man": "Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.]Phyllis Lapin.It’s from Bob.No, it’s not.[with flowers] Can you sign?",
    "Meredith": "“Happy Valentine’s Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.”Yeah. Wow.",
    "Phyllis": "Isn’t he sweet?Really, Oh, they’re from Bob again.Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]",
    "Michael": "Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.Nope. The opposite of that.Ok, good.I probably will, why do you ask?Yeah.is your problem?This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine’s Day. It’s New York. City of Love.Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?Alright.Dude, I’m gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.The meeting isn’t ’til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I’m gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you’re in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that’s pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.Everybody takes the subway in New York. It’s fast, it’s efficient, gets you there on time. It’s a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there’s a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it’s, that’s Tina Fey [points]. That’s Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I’m sorry, I thought you were [Conan O’Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn’t. So… Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.I would love to live in New York someday. It’s a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It’d be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it’s the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that’s either the Hudson or the East, so we’re back,  should be back this way. There’s a lotta pressure on me right now. It’s like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it’s over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let’s do it.There they are. What’s up? Hey hey.Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?So what’s going on? What I miss?Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and… [awkward silence]Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that’s not. Cool it.Maybe because she’s my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She’s… we hooked up and…You know, months ago, just once, It’s, just stupid. Just forget it,Yeah, yeah.Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that’s the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we’re not just in the paper business, we’re in the people business. Let’s meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley’s dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark’s of the foundation of the business we’re hoping to build our bases on.Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won’t. You know, not what this is about.And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it’s like to walk a mile in Oscar’s shoes. Or try on Phyllis’ pants.  Maybe even one of Angela’s famous brownies. And you’ll know, that you’re home.Questions?Yes, thank you.Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm… [hands over report]Oh, ok. Alright.No you’re not.Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So…Yes. I’m sorry. I will fix this. I’ll talk to him. I’ll talk to David.I am serious. And don’t call me Shirley. Airplane.No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here’s the deal. It’s my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]I know. It was borderline at best and… And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I’m really sorry. It will never happen again.Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.Yeah, Happy Valentine’s Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]Oy vey… schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]",
    "Dwight": "And you want me to come with you.I will stay here and run things on this end.Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you’re in New York?Well… It’s Valentine’s Day, and you guys, you know…Screwed.What’s this? What is this?Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine’s Day. [pulls out bobble head] It’s me. I’m the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I’ve ever gotten.Oh I did. I did.Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you… privately?No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room][same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn’t get anything for this particular person – who shall remain nameless – is that she’s not really the kind of person you’d think would be into Valentine’s Day. She’s kind of…(smirking) Exactly.You mean, like a ham?Ok, I get it.Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",
    "Oscar": "The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.My mom. [puts card in pocket]",
    "Jim": "So I broke up with Katy and haven’t been dating anybody else, so this year I don’t have to worry about Valentine’s Day. It’s gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We’re gonna play some cards and I’ll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they’re idiots. It’s gonna be great.I dunno, it’s ondesk.It was there when I sat down.Hey Kelly. What’s up?OH, that’s great. I’m really happy for [starts to walk away]Wow.Wow.No, don’t be.I bet.Alright. [Kelly squeals][on phone] Nah that’s alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That’s fine. No, I didn’t even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.Take it slow. ‘Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need… [Ryan walks in][under breath] Oh, no, not while I’m here.You know what? Here’s the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It’d be great, but he isn’t.Well, he’s not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day.",
    "Kelly": "Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.And it was so funny ’cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn’t making a move, so in my head I was like “Ryan, what’s taking you so long?” And then he kissed me. And I didn’t know what to say.So I said, “Ryan, what took you so long?” And I just said that to him, can you believe that?Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I’m embarrassed.Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.So nervous, but now — now I have a boyfriend.I don’t know what he’s thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so… do you want to… do something tonight? Or…I mean, I know it’s Valentine’s Day, or whatever, but there’s totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So…OK, That’s cool. I completely understand.It’s frustrating, because we’d be so perfect together.Yeah, it would be so great if he was.Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]",
    "Ryan": "[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.Soda.I can’t tonight. I have plans with my friends.Cool. Cool. OK.",
    "Kevin": "Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]Man, that thing’s bigger than I am.Oh zip it.Whose it from? [to Oscar]",
    "Angela": "Really? I wouldn’t know anything about that, but I’m glad you enjoyed it.I didn’t get anything for Valentine’s Day.Really? Well, I hope I do.Nothing for me?",
    "Craig": "Hey.What’s up buddy?Guilty, yeah.Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said “You gotta fire four people,” and I was just like, “What?” Ya know?No, I just ignored her. She’s the worse.She ain’t my boss dude. I don’t work for that bitch.What? You like Jan? How can youJan?Yeah. Here’s the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on… like report or whatnot.I was under the impression this was, more of like… a meet and greet type deal.That is correct, yes.Look, I’m sorry, I didn’t know.Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn’t get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]",
    "Josh": "Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake]You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.Not much, they’re uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we’re just waiting for the presentations.What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?Did you?She is our boss.You hooked up with Jan?Yeah, let’s change the subject.Nice to meet you.So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.Thank you.",
    "Jan": "Josh Porter, Stamford.And Michael Scott, Scranton.Fine Michael. Thank you.Nervous, no I’m not nervous. Well, I guess I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I’m very nervous.OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,Um, I’m sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?Craig, you realize that we’re trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?Well, the point is, is that doesn’t exactly bode well for your branch.NO, NO I’m not, I’m not, I just… I just don’t know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we’re all gonna get fired.Yeah, Michael – the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can’t believe that you told everybody and we didn’t even sleep together.Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It’s over. Do you understand?Surely, you cannot be serious?Uh, that’s fine. Let’s just forget it.Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.Oh, no, it’s OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine’s Day.Oh.",
    "David": "David [to Josh and shakes hands]Nice to meet you.OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company’s financial strengths. All I’d like to do today is to…Thanks very much.OK, Michael.Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch’s performance, so do you have that information as well?So, does that mean you don’t have the numbers on your branch?You understand this is a very serious situation.You made a joke?Well I don’t need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss…Good. [Michael leaves office]",
    "Dan": "And that about does it, thank you.",
    "Roy": "Hey babe.You almost ready to go?What’s wrong?What, you’re mad at me?Well, Valentine’s Day isn’t over. Let’s get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life."
