    "Michael": "Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.Let’s go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.Lay them on me. What?That’s not what you said earlier.The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That’s what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um… Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.I think it was you who didn’t look closely enough at the Gold Plan.Well, I’d recommend it. It’s very good.You gotta crack these things open.Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um… It won’t be popular decision around the old orifice.Well, it’s a suicide mission, you know.There, there…[scoffs] When have you ever done that?Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.There’s a decision that needs to be made, and I’m having an unbelievably a busy day. So I’m going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.Yeah!Really?Ah, none. You’re picking a health care plan.You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.Nope, you cannot use it.Temporary workspace. You can use it.If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we’ve talked about that already.[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How’s tricks?Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I’m busy, busy, busy. Can’t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody’s doing. Everybody cool out there?Pam! Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I’m getting a call.I have to make a call after I finish… my work. You know what? Uh, just don’t let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I’m just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?Ah, what? Which memo?Is it a good plan?Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don’t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there’s some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn’t matter. The point is, they’re not unhappy anymore. They’re out there thinking, “Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He’s cool. I… what a great guy. I love him. I…him.You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn’t find the knob.So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so…[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.Its says here that it’s a 300ft drop.So it’s not a free fall?Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what… you got laser tag or something?OK, so I don’t know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It’s all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don’t you take two? Because you don’t get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.Why don’t you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.There you go.Uh, nope. Nope. This isn’t the surprise. It’s surprising, um… because you didn’t expect it. But you will… you’ll know it when you see it.[under his breath] Oh, Christ.Well, what? You could be referring to anything.Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?Oh come on! That’s horrible! Aaah… Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and… what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it’s after five. Oh, oh it’s awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.Oh… Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And… here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is… Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll… Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.[clapping hands] God, yeah… Ah! This…Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] “Hi. I’m Mork from Ork.” Well, I’m Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.",
    "Pam": "I’m not making any copies.Nothing new.There’s nothing new.Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the… [nods toward camera]No. I have a life.You should try it sometime.[laughs]… your problem.Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.Where are you?Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out ’cause the…No you’re not.OK.Still no one calling.Dwight, what…OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?Dwight’s health care memo. I told you about it.Michael, he made huge cuts.Where are you going?I’m inventing new diseases.So, let’s say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?Nice.It’s an epidemic.[on phone] Hey, Jim. It’s Pam.Good, how are you? Busy?Um, I’m not bothering you, am I?You don’t have anything you’re doing?Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I’m not really doing anything.I might go to the mall.I need new shoes.Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.",
    "Jan": "So, which health plan have you decided on?Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?The Gold Plan? I’m not even on that plan.Michael.You know the whole reason that we’re doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.It’s your job. So…Michael… maybe… I mean…Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.I’m doing it right now. To you.Hello?This is Jan.Who is this?From sales?Where’s Michael Scott?Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?Really?OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.No. Please don’t use my cell phone ever again.",
    "Jim": "Last night on Trading Spouses, there’s… have you seen it?Interesting, what’s that like?Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is…Gosh.That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.Yeah. I just don’t think this is the kind of task, that I… am going to do. You know who would be great for this?Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I’d have to throw myself in front of a train.It says “workspace”.If it’s the same thing, then why did you write “workspace”?You are not my superior.I thought it was a workspace?You cut more than you had to, didn’t you?Well, why did you do that? You work here, don’t you want good insurance?OK, well, if you’ve never been sick, then you don’t have any antibodies.OK, you know what Dwight? We can’t write our diseases down for you because that’s confidential.Workspace.Wait. What are you writing? Don’t write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? ‘Cause I’m suffering from both.Oh, great.I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That’s spontaneous dental hydroplosion.Thank you.What are you talking about?OK, whoa. ‘Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they’re fake?Absolutely not.No I didn’t.Killer nanorobots?Sounds tough.Do you?Mmm hmm.Yep.Good luck. [closes door and locks it][answering phone] Jim Halpert.Who is this?No, you can’t fire me.OK, can you hold on? I’m getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.Hey Pam! How are you?I’m doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?No, not at all.I have nothing to do.Oh yeah?The mall?Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?",
    "Dwight": "Yes. I can do it. I’m your man.OK, first, let’s go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?OK, we’ll table that for the time being. Two, I’ll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.OK, I take it back, it’s a workspace.Thank you.What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don’t believe in coddling people.In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, “Ow, I hurt my leg. I can’t run. A lion eats me and I’m dead.” Well, I’m not dead. I’m the lion. You’re dead.Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.Same thing.Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.Oh gee, then why do I have an office?Yes. And my decision in final.Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.Sure.Don’t need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.I don’t need them. Superior genes. I’m a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.So I can lower it.It’s a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.Yeah, you said…I can handle that.OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I’d like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I’ll see what I can do.OK, well, I didn’t say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don’t write any disease down at all and it won’t be covered. Sound fair? Good. I’ll be in my office.Damnit! Damnit Jim!All right, who did this? I’m not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.You did this, didn’t you?Yes you did.I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I’ll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won’t receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] “Count Choculitis”Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?I think you need to confess……the fact…What are you doing? Those are my keys.Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let… [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]Let me out.Let me out or you’re fired.Yes I can. I’m manager for the day. Clean out your desk.Jim! Open the door!Jim!Jim!Jim!Jim!Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.Dwight Schrute.Well…He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.That’s not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.Yeah.Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your… [dial tone]Michael. Michael?I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.I’m now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I’ll make sure that’s covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?Yeah, but no one here has it.I most certainly did not.Oh, um… Jan wants you to call her.",
    "Stanley": "There’s no dental, there’s no vision, there’s a $1,200 deductible.[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] …the light green or green…Oh, thanks.This isn’t the big surprise, is it? Because we’ve been having a pretty horrible day.What about confidentiality?We all think you don’t have a surprise.",
    "Oscar": "He literally won’t come out of his office.Michael, can I talk to you?It’s like a pay decrease.This is not good.What was that?I don’t know, Kevin. This is important. I don’t want… [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.I don’t know.Well?OK, the health care plan.",
    "Kevin": "He’s got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.What are you guys talking about?That’s a real thing.Someone has it.Do you think we should go ?What is he doing?",
    "Angela": "Kevin! That’s inappropriate.It’s ridiculous. Did you talk to him?You let him walk all over you. It’s just pathetic.Nothing, Kevin.What about the surprise?",
    "Meredith": "Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.",
    "Travel Agent": "I don’t know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?",
    "Man on Phone": "You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It’s not really a ride.It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.It’s an industrial coal elevator.",
    "Ryan": "Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the…"
