    "Dwight": "How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So thatâ€™s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.I donâ€™t see it.Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]In a way itâ€™s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday theyâ€™ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then Iâ€™ll have a grandson.Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?Well, weâ€™re both just kinda learning as we go, arenâ€™t we?Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?Spoken like a true root man.My calls?You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?OkWith my leads and stuff like that?Cause youâ€™re interested in going into sales?Wow, thatâ€™s great. Thatâ€™s great. Ok, good, letâ€™s talk about that, ok?Youâ€™re not getting my clients! Nice try.Paranoid? Iâ€™m not familiar with the word. And I really donâ€™t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.Wait, salesâ€”what sales meeting?The new guys called a sales meeting?Thereâ€™s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?Boo, unimpressed. Itâ€™s a tightrope for babies. Boo!Ok, I am just getting started, ok?[bleeding heavily from the mouth] Thatâ€™s not true.  Just give me another chance.What?This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesnâ€™t seem so macho now, does it? Itâ€™s a jump rope!Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.Come here, Iâ€™ll show you.Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means itâ€™s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldnâ€™t you say?So youâ€™ll do it?Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.Come on.No, Pam.Please? Please, Pam?I canâ€™t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar Iâ€™ll be launched into space. God, youâ€™re so insensitive.Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.[Jim tries dialing and hangs up]Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and Iâ€™m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!Woo!

    "Doctor": "Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father.",
    "Angela": "I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. Heâ€™s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pantsPlease, after the turtle?Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasnâ€™t given me a definite yes or no.Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, Iâ€™m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, youâ€™re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?Why do you want this cat?How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?Have you taken any concrete steps?Allergies.No, the baby. Please, itâ€™s my husbandâ€™s favorite cat. Heâ€™s broken up about it. Itâ€™s the only time Iâ€™ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He wonâ€™t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonightPlease donâ€™t teach the cat French.",
    "Kevin": "Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But Iâ€™m not that good at puzzles.So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldnâ€™t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?Angelaâ€™s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you canâ€™t eat cats. You canâ€™t eat cats, Kevin.Iâ€™ll take him.I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!Go ahead",
    "Oscar": "[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesnâ€™t go there. [Kevin shushes him]No, Iâ€™m a dog person.Those guys always change back, Angela.Definitely no.But your mouth is bleâ€”You know what? I will take Comstock.Iâ€™ll come by after work and pick him up.Câ€™est la vie.[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.",

I mean, its just a paper company.Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I donâ€™t think anythingâ€™s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids thereâ€™s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.Dwight![sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?I will?Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.No.Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.Exactly the way it is.Yes, and thereâ€™s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.Find someone else, I donâ€™t know. Ask Phyllis.You ready?Kay.",
    "Jim": "You are really good at modesty. Sheâ€™s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kidsâ€™ room. Thereâ€™s a hippo leading a parade of 500 childrenâ€”Oh, yeahIts sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.In Philly, so, that doesnâ€™t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.An Altima or better.we good?No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredithâ€™s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.Done. Explain.Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.The new guys called one.Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?You should ask him. Itâ€™s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.You a sports fan?Oh. Any team sports?Phillies fan, though, right?No, like baseball. A baseball team.Ok. Good talk.I have nothing in common with Plop.Oh, come on, Pete! God, thatâ€™s just sad. If he doesnâ€™t watch himself, heâ€™s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.Yeah. You know what? Iâ€™ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.Hey, man. Itâ€™s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, donâ€™t. Iâ€™m in. Yeah, yep, Iâ€™m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!",

But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.Why are you getting rid of it?Your husband?",
    "Andy": "Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, itâ€™ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!Whatâ€™re you still doing here?You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. Itâ€™s Clark and, umâ€”In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.Cause youâ€™re always taking dumps.Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.Whoa! Mind blown. Itâ€™s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]David, outward bound was incredible.

Itâ€™s going to be terrible.No Iâ€™m going to make sure that it is. And if it isnâ€™t, Iâ€™m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I donâ€™t like to throw around the b-word, but Iâ€™m going to be a huge bitch to you.Now this is called slack lining.I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then youâ€™ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.Thatâ€™s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athleteâ€™s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.All right, whoâ€™s next? Nellie?Nonsense. Get up here.Come on.

Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.",
    "Darryl": "Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.Go, Dwight Jr!",
    "David": "Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.",
    "Rafe": "Iceman.",
    "Creed": "In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company."
