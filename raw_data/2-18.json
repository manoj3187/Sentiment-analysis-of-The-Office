    "Pam": "I’m looking forward to ‘Take Your Daughter to Work’ day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I’m getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. …Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]Oh, Michael.

    "Michael": "Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w—… Oh, God is that today?Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid’s environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I’m going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in “Raw,” and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in “Daddy Daycare.” both great movies, but, still.Well, I’ll be in my office.They’re cool.Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children.

Where does he live, guys?[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you’ve really grown up. You know what? Don’t mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the… frat boys away from her.Oh.Yeah, middle school’s amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.It’s not that children make me uncomfortable, it’s just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I’ve never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?Okay.[on phone] Just compare last year’s order to this year’s. Uh-huh. Yeah, I’m looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] … Yes. We–yeah, they’re very–they’re different.

Well… we can… [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael’s toy train] uhm… hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I’ll call you right back. Yes, I promise. …Hello, can I help you? … You can pick that up, if you want. That’s— that’s alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael’s desk] Want to bring it over… here, make some room. My name’s Michael. What’s your name?Nice to meet you.Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I’m the conductor.

They’re going to have nightmares, so why don’t you just shut it?[sighing] Why don’t you just leave? Okay?Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That’s paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?No, we don’t actually cut the paper. That’s a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.Yes it is, well, w-w–you need someone in the middle to facilitate…I’m not just a middle… man…You are describing Office Depot, and they’re kind of running us out of business.…There’s Creed! Let’s take a look at what he’s doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of… something. Right?Say hi to the kids.Yaaaaay.What are you doing? N–stop it! Stop it! Just–no, no, no, no! No!

[gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother’s house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled ‘Fundle Bundle’. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?Oka–Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.[to Abby] Alright, nowwww… what kind… of pizza do you like?I don’t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives… They’re adults, for God’s sake.I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called ‘Fundle Bundle.’ Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?That… is Miss Trudy. Can’t tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can… fast forward. And… I want you… to…Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.Yeah.Uhh, I don’t know.Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don’t miss it.Oh! That’s me. Shh.

Bye.[Toby knocks on door] Yeah?Oh, that’s okay, she can keep those.Thank you.You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.Well, sure, playing the field is great, don’t get me wrong, but there’s more to life than notches just on my bedpost.Tell me something honestly, do you… think… that it is too late for me to have kids?What about……Jan. Kay.…Or biologically.Thanks, that’s, no, that… that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I…Oh… kay.Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And… I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.Hey, uh, no, please? You can’t leave yet. There’s still one more thing we need to do.[singing] You… who are on the road… must have a code… that you can live by… [Dwight joins in] and so… become yourself… because the past… is just a goodbye… and teach… your children well…One more time. [singing] You…",
    "Jim and Dwight": "[in unison] That’s Batman.",
    "Dwight": "[looks at Sasha] Mmm… hello tiny one.You are the future!There is no way that hurt.Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don’t have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don’t feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You’re so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight’s bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector’s items, okay?No, I don’t have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.You call your mom Meredith? That’s very disrespectful.You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.Schrute. Mister Schrute.[quietly] … Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight][plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat… a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it’s called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs— are you listening, Sasha? Right? And ‘ere they dream when he’s about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!There’s a photo…These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these—[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement……from the 1930’s…I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.…Okay.We have better service than they do!Is that a real fun shooting windmill?[employees chuckle] And heon TV now!Uh, okay. But first, that’s not my name.Well at least I’m not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So…And they do, your parents, love you very much.The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren’t enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn’t eat the children.",
    "Toby": "[to Sasha] Come on.[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.Alright, I wasn’t expecting that. Let’s uh… let’s go draw.I think these belong to you.

    "Angela": "Can you put that down there?No. Thanks. We’d… have to explain everything, it’s probably just easier if we do it ourselves.I guess I wouldn’t mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].",

    "Sasha": "Do you need any help?Sasha.Ooh! [picks up train whistle]Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously][to Phyllis] Are you Mother Goose?What’s a Nazi?So, do you have any kids?So you didn’t get to be what you wanted to be.",
    "Ryan": "Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I’m learning that fun for Kelly is… getting married and having babies. Immediately.
