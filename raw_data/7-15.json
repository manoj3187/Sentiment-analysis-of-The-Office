    "Pam": "Hey. How you doing?Yeah.At least she lived a very long and I’m sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you’re ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we’re thinking about you.It’s possible that some people thought it was your birthday.I’m so sorry.How much did you give him?Wait. I don’t have my scarf.I’m missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh][loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue… station. And what else was there?Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?Yeah. What? Us?Yeah!Yeah!That’s weird. I mean, that’s weird to have sex in the office. That’s where you work, right?You know, you’re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you’ve had sex there, except for you and him.Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.No, we weren’t.No.That was so embarrassing. I’m gonna die.Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.Besides, we have something those other people don’t have, which is a home and a bed.No.We took a walk.",
    "Darryl": "Thinking about my grandmother a lot.She was about to turn 97.Thank you. “Congratulations, Darryl. Let’s get wasted.” “Have fun today, big guy.” “Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.”“Hooray. Live it up big D. ” “Days like this don’t come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this”?[tears welling up in his eyes]Rachel from the party?Nice. Do the damn thing. – Pow! [they fist bump and explode]Yeah, it’s a little much.Obviously, so happy for them both.That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.Okay. I’ll keep working.I can hear you.You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.Pick it up.Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.Make that face he likes.",
    "Andy": "Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!…thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!……So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I’m taking Rachel. She’s picking me up after work.Oh, yeah!What’s up?Are you kidding me? It’s all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably…Well, okay then.At least until Stanley calms down.D…d…d…d…don’t look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]She’s neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl’s cousin’s party. We were the only two white people there.Hey, look at that. Done.I wish you well on your quest.Aww, I mean…Okay.Whoa.[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.I think he can hear us.[softly] That makes sense, ’cause I feel like I’d be able to hear us at this level.Darryl is a jerk.No, I’m just testing if he can hear.Oh. Okay.The temp at night?Pi…Okay.Right. Okay.Okay, Ryan’s the temp. What does he do at night?Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]How romantic is this?Right. Do you see a clue or…Oh, my gosh.No time to chat.Hey.B-9.Maybe it’s just more like, “be mine.”Mm.Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]",
    "Phyllis": "Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won’t do it, but they will if you make a scene.Mm-hmm.Yeah, and it’s not just the kissing. It’s the flirtatious whispering.",
    "Holly": "Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I’ll miss you.Bye.Okay, one more quick one.Ohh. Can you get lower?A little lower.I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He’s a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.So we kiss occasionally.Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.Oh, no. Michael, I don’t want to make people uncomfortable.Yeah, but if they’re uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.Okay.Two people in love?Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We’ve only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, “oh, hey, there’s Holly. I love that girl.” Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]I love you.Hello.No, don’t touch.No touching.Oh.Almost got you.You’re not touching me.And here.Okay.You said you would.No, I don’t think so.Yes. Number three.Give me all your money and take off your clothes.Come one. Nobody’s looking. What’s wrong?Maybe we didn’t want to think about it. We can make it work. We’ll date long-distance.We weren’t in love last time.I’m not saying it won’t be hard. But we can make it work. That’s what she said.Hi.What? What are you talking about?No, we’re gonna talk now. You’re not breaking up with me.What if I said it wasn’t up to them?The company. Nobody knows our future, but it’s not gonna be decided by the company. It’s not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.You do?[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]",
    "Michael": "Miss you. Okay. I’ll be in my office if you need me.Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye… bye.Don’t go. I don’t want you to go. Oh don’t go. Don’t go.Holly and I are dating. It’s been a week, and I still can’t believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can’t work for it. It just comes to you.[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?Okay.Are you… are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? ‘Cause you’re grossing me out.Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly’s back]Oh, yeah.[clears throat][sitting in Holly’s lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.What, are you talking about me and Holly?Whispering and tickling have their place in business.I… Okay, yeah, that’s pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.Thank you.All right.Okay. Fine. No more PDA.You win. But here’s what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.Anything goes.Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we’re gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?Pro.What? Problem solved.No, no, it’s great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.Ah, the old “leave behind.” Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it’s working.Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don’t… I don’t sit on your lap because it’s comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we’ll stop.Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine’s Day.I love you.I love you-love you.I am really disappointed in the office’s policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly’s hand]Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.Hello, Holly.Here, shake. No!No, we can’t.No touching. Ah, I’m trying not to touch you.Oh.Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can’t do that. We can’t do this. Ohh.I don’t know what your body feels like ’cause I can’t touch it.Grab you here.I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]Never.I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can’t stop. You don’t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.Yes, it was that. It’s that one.We’re not supposed to PDA.I haven’t thought about you having to go back to Nashua.That’s what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How’s this gonna be any different?I was in love with you.[chuckles, sighs]It’s like a time bomb……is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.Sexual time bomb.[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.No, I can’t talk to her. I can’t even look at her without thinking about it ending.Do the monkey face.I love that. I love that face.No. The monkey!Don’t do the squirrel. Throw your poop.That’s good.That’s good. He’s throwing it.I know.Holly. Hey.Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.Actually, it’s Valentine’s Day. Shouldn’t be doing this today. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.You’re gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can’t handle it. So let’s just…let’s…Who?Okay. Okay.Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine’s Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.I do.What are our plans for tonight? Umm…",
    "Gabe": "And what do we have here?Come on.I dominate Valentine’s Day. I practically make romance into a science.Oh, close. It’s a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.Well, get to work.The puzzle is the clue.[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It’s this horrible plipping sound. You know, it’s like Chinese water torture. Just…[makes popping sound] like it’s coming from my own head.Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.Yes?Seeing as it’s Valentine’s Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you’d expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.I get it. Andy’s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.They don’t touch. They don’t kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.Okay. So, PDAs. That’s gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh…Yeah, booby honking. Sure.Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.Sure. Basically, there’s no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.Maybe you find your own chair.You have to cut it out.No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it’s reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One:You’re taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I’ve done it, and I know the feeling.Number two:You’re desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three:You’re at an age where your sexual climaxes aren’t as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.",
    "Erin": "From my secret admirer. That’s you!“Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.” Oh, my gosh. It’s a romantic scavenger hunt!But, there’s no clue.I can’t, ’cause there’s no clue.Oh.Psst! Psst!Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?Okay.Oh! No, no, no, no. It’s not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.Yes!Oh, is he…Andy.So tell me about your new girlfriend.Aww, cute.That’s Gabe’s boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.No, come on.[growling] Come on!Ha!Don’t mind us. You keep working.Oh, my God. It’s a song.What do you think is on it?[softly] Not if we’re talking like this. I think it’s okay. He doesn’t seem to hear us.Darryl.No, he’s not.Okay. Then no more talking. Let’s just play the song.What do you…I guess we just have to wait until night and see.[gasps] Oh. Cool.Super romantic.Yeah. Did you not see it? [“Eat at Hanks” is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]Hanks.Sorry.Oh. One Erin Special, please.[laughs] That’s my favorite.[at vending machine] B-9.Like a benign tumor.Oh, yes. There’s a note. “A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine’s kiss.”Mm. Oh. We’re suppose to…mmm [leans in to kiss Andy]",
    "Oscar": "[clears throat]The numbers are correct, Michael.[clears throat more loudly]I jus… I just need a signature.Yes! The freaking PDA!Thank you! I mean, I’m thrilled for them.Yes, yes, absolutely.So happy. Yeah.Kevin!Are you guys listening to this?Not occasionally. All the time.Good.Just leave it how you said…Okay, this is much worse than before.Are you kidding? I wasn’t trying to break you guys up.Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]I just told them to do it!",
    "Jim": "[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.Big tip.What?We decided to have a Valentine’s day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine’s day dinner thing. It’s a whole thing.Shh.Um, bottomless champagne.No.[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles][goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.Aww, nuts. [laughs]OOH! Boom! Face!Did it!Love it. Keep it goin.Mm-hmm.[snorts] Ew.Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he’s not here.Definitely not. That’s disgusting.Hey, you don’t have to…That was really rough.No, because the office isn’t what I’d consider a romantic place.And a shower.What?No. We took a walk.",
    "Dwight": "Okay, my name is j…j…j…j…j…j…j…j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you… under you. I’ll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p…p…p…p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn’t really. [clears throat]You’re just filling that out right now. That wasn’t meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.Michael. Confession:I have done PDA in the office.I’ve had intercourse in the office.As has Angela!As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.Michael, that’s absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?Yes!Hey. Hey. Come on. You’re hurting him.Shh.Just hush.Just rock. Shh.Movie idea?Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.Kevin! Do more stupid faces.I don’t know.Do the monkey face!Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.Go back to the monkey!Hurl your feces.Good.They really do that.My perfect Valentine’s Day? I’m at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.",
    "Angela": "I don’t know if anyone else feels this way and don’t get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I’m being overly sensitive, but… the PDA.Uh-huh.No one is more thrilled for them than I am……but it’s totally inappropriate.No, stop! Just don’t.God! Kevin!Dwight!With who?No.",
    "Kevin": "I don’t know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because…Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying…I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.Oooh.Booby honking.Butt honking.As has Kevin!She goes to another school.Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.Better luck next time, pal.Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.",
    "Everyone": "[groans]",
    "Ryan": "Speaking of, Gabe, I don’t see Erin at this meeting.Hey. You’re looking for me?No you weren’t.You wanted to have sex in my office.No. It’s… it’s cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you’re finished. I’ll be out here.Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.",
    "Meredith": "Uh, I also don’t see Andy.",
    "Creed": "The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap…",
    "Stanley": "The flirtatious tickling.",
    "Boom Box": "[Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.",
