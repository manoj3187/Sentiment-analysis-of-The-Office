    "Dwight": "Stop it!You’re talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke’s on you ’cause I know Morse Code. Ha!Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!Michael, come on.Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]Eel fishing.Are you nuts?Oh, no.Oh, God, that tickles. What did…I think I’ve got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]$100 a day, plus expenses.I’m just gonna warn you… and I say this to all my clients… you might not like what I find.And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves][sitting on his Firebird’s hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.I work with Michael.Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna’s attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.It’s all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]Yeah, I’m good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?Tractor pulling. Too bad there’s not a tractor here.[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who’s next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don’t quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you’re getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?Really? Hey, um… [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his “workout”]Get out of my way. Huh!Tomorrow’s fertilizer, am I right?Donna. Donna, wait, please. I’m sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I’m here:to see… you… naked… while… I’m… naked.Donna, come… Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his “workout” and cannot chase Donna]Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.Yeah, no. She’s not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]Put your fingers here.I’m positive. Yeah, oh, and here’s your expense receipts right there.People who don’t trust egg whites.Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she’s coming over here and she’s furious.You’re right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] “What is with him? He is crazy. I’m coming over there to talk to him.” And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You’ll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael’s office.[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let’s take this next hill.You know what? You had your chance. You’re no leader. Out of your seat, let’s blast!No! The hill’s a trap. Let’s take the dirt road off to the side.If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one… jump! No! [points to those around him] You’re dead, you’re dead, you’re dead. Good jump. You’re barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.In memory of Larry Einhorn.",
    "Jim": "Stop what?[chuckles] Yeah. That’s what we’re doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.Yup. That’s exactly what we did.It’s a pen.You do?But you didn’t believe any of this was true five minutes ago.That’s interesting. Wow, it’s a little early for ice cream, don’t you think?Oh, my GodYou know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just… stop beating yourself up.Michael, no…You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.[to Pam] What?Wait, so are you… you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.",
    "Pam": "It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, “I will when you lose the baby weight.”Stanley got to go.No, Michael, no.You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place…That is right. Don’t make any more of it.How what?You could start by concluding this meeting.Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.Amok. It means, don’t let your imagination run out of control.Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.Oh!…Why do we have to see what Dwight says?No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.Michael. Okay, I’m… I’m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you’re in.Helene.My mother.My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]Hmm? Oh. It’s probably nothing.Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn’t Michael.No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It’s Cece. [laughs] She’s never gonna do anything wrong.Hey, Michael.I’m sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.I lied it’s personal. It’s about me and Jim. We’re… I just… you’re the only person I can talk to.And…No, not… we’re not… we’re not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love…Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!I love [leans over Michael’s desk to look at his computer screen]… this idea is neat. I’ve never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out][to Michael] You’re gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at… golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?Absolutely. [both leave Michael’s office]I don’t know who he is.What?You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.You have to settle down first.Okay. Okay. Yes.Yeah, but you have to calm…Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael[gasps] Did she see me?",
    "Michael": "Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?Get back to work, Dwight. Please.Ooh! Things with Donna are so… oh-ho-ho! They’re going great. I, uh… we’re just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and… orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I’m actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.Okay.Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.Yeah, well, Stanley doesn’t help with anything. Come on. Shout ’em out, shout ’em out.Oh!That’s fun.All right.We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang’s.Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, “I wanna go to Mount Pocono,” you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World:Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn’t see.You guys think Donna’s cheating on me?… and… we had sex, too.How?How do I not make any more of it?All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won’t say, “I love you.”Nine dates. I said it on the second date.Yeah, she does all that.No, no…Run what?Why didn’t you just say that, Pam?Well, that’s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It’s stupid. I live in a fantasy world.Yes, Jim, I do. And I can’t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.That’s what makes it so wrong.Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that’s what’s killing me.[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.This is you. How much do you charge?I’ll give you $50. Money’s no object.Okay.It’s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn’t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.It’s comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.I know. Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll see what Dwight says.Because I have him investigating her. I’m waiting for a text update.It’s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.God, this is so disgusting.I know.That’s not true. [Pam stares him down] You’re right, I ruin everything. And I’ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.Helene?Oh.Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]You’re back. What happened?No, what happened with Donna?Ugh!No. No! Are you sure?Who eats eight protein bars?Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.What? No, she didn’t say that.I am not paying for that membership.[sitting on the floor behind Erin’s desk, sighs] Ohhh… mmm…No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?That’s her?Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I’ll talk to you later.I didn’t. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.Ye… pfff. Well, no. It’s a lie. That’s not what happened. I just like you. I can’t believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]…poop my pants.Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?We are?Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That’s exciting.Hey.Well it can wait. It can wait.Jim is her husband.And they are having problems, so sh…Good in bed.Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?Okay, weirdo.Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?I’m gonna kill him. No, I’m not. I feel… I… no, I’m not going to kill him.I have to hear it from her.I need to have her tell me herself. Right?I need to have her say…I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”No, God! No, no, oh, my God![calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.You know what? We should really do something fun this week.Wouldn’t that be fun?How about Thursday?I can’t do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?Oh, really? ’cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It’d be a great, great concert.Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.Nope, that’s Tuesday.You’re cheating. You’re cheating on me.Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]Who is he?The other man. Who’s the guy? Who is it?I’m the mistress?",
    "Stanley": "I have an idea for your weekend.Let me get back to my desk right now.My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.",
    "Andy": "Walk around apple orchards.Super romantic.How many dates have you been on?Mm.Of course. Yeah, that’s terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It’s really important.Yeah, I don’t know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.What are we gonna do about this?Let me know what they say.What do you mean?I don’t know.What’s up? I got your e-mail.Okay.Such as?What? You don’t know what it meant? How about “Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?”[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.Creed’s head of quality assurance. So he’d definitely be wrapped up in this.Your text said 911.What’s bad?Oh, God.I might have to go public here, but no one’s gonna believe me. Uh… I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.Yeah.There what is?[in old Michael Scott Paper Company’s “office”] We’re printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy’s demonstration]Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you’re watching this, it’s because I’ve turned State’s witness because I’m in danger because I know too much.Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention…Make it higher? Okay.[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation…[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger… [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It’s working. [in normal voice] It’s… I knew it!We are blowin’ the roof off! Blowin’ the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He’s been my partner through this entire thing.",
    "Darryl": "Curl up with your favorite DVD.[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.You didn’t feel like he was hiding something?Like he was… covering something up? Maybe.Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said “Darryl, just wait. He’s a fool. There’s gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.” [smiles]Close the door.I don’t have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It’s like jazz. [scatting] Andy don’t mess with me. [continues scatting] I’ll figure something out.Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.It was kind of mumbled, I don’t know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was “Andy,” “Problem,” “Eliminate,” something. I don’t know what it meant.Whoa. I hadn’t even thought of that.Look, I’m not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]It’s bad.It’s real bad.Still no plan.It’s getting bigger.I can videotape it.[to camera] There it is.What?You haven’t even introduced yourself.You should talk in a higher voice ’cause the camera makes you sound weird.Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]Mm-hmmOne more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]This… [removes camera headset]I don’t wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It’s not funny. I’m just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.",
    "Meredith": "You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.",
    "Kelly": "Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang’s when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.Wait, that’s crazy far. Are you sure she’s not cheating?Oh, hey, I love your earrings.Did Michael get them for you?Where?Claire’s? Zales? Ricky’s? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor’s Place?",
    "Ryan": "Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It’s in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she…Sorry, dude.",
    "Oscar": "That seems… quick. Even for lesbians.",
    "Gabe": "There’s no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?That’s weird. I haven’t heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.I don’t know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That’s what I’ll do today. All right. Yeah.[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We’ve investigated. Every time it’s been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don’t know. That’s why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I’d like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That’s god for five bucks at Dunkin’ Donuts. Any Dunkin’ Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]",
    "Donna": "Oh, hi. You work for Michael.Right.Donna, hi.Thank you.You okay?[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you’re talking about.Nope. I’m good, thanks.I’m out of here.You stay away from me, or I’m calling security.How could you think I would cheat on you?That’s pathetic.When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]I told you I like you.Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would…Have you ever been to Vero Beach?We’re going.Yeah.Thank you.No, I bought them myself.Steamtown Mall.You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.Uh, Franklin Mills.Isn’t that something?Oh.Yeah I think it’ll be a nice trip. We’re gonna get a lot done.I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]Yeah, we should.Yeah.Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?Oh, Friday doesn’t work.Shoot. I’m working.Well, won’t you be at the concert?Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.How do you know?What, what do you mean?It’s you. I’m married.",
    "Old lady": "Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?",
    "Erin": "Maybe you’d be more comfortable in your own office.Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.Yeah.",
    "Creed": "Psst… [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell’s a chump. I would have done it for anything. I’ve done a lot more for a lot less.",
