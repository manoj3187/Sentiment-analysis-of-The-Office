    "Michael": "All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering]This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.Dwight, Dwight!No, I will ex-squeeze you.OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.Jimbo.Did you see Holly’s butt?Why?I know.I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she’s allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read “Lonesome Dove” three times.And that her butt refuses to quit![follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That’s insane.I thought you had to pee.[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey![frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It’s really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?No. OK. Um, the last word is “seagulls.”I took a lot from other poems.All right, call– [leans in to kiss Pam]OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let’s move that up. Here we go.All right.All right![rapping] I’m MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She’s DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who’s your daddy? You don’t know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don’t. [to Jan] Come on. Let’s go in.No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don’t we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!Pam, I’d like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.Oh, calm down, weirdo. It’s just a joke. She’s such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can’t find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?Let’s go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.OK, everybody, let’s suck in our guts.Damn it. Come on.Here we go. Everybody on.How’s it going?Good.Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis]Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went — I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?No.Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don’t follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?This is how we’re gonna do it. Five pounds. I’m asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim’s 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.Booty call.Here.Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don’t want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.You want more?[music playing] It’s a pretty lame party.You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.Let’s go mini-golfing.Uh…Um, I think you’ll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.You know what? We’re pretty much done here today. Why don’t you just take off early?Yeah.Good luck.Oh, Holly doesn’t need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?And what is that?You know, we’re gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.I did!Yes.  Gooooo-tee!Hey, you know what?  I can’t do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms][groans painfully][struggling to speak] Mmm— mmm…  Um…Close the door.  This is your fault.Your stupid friend zone.I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh—  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh][in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I’ll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma’s House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.It’s my sumo suit.  I just didn’t inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.If it’s me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, “Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?”How do you know Michael Clump?How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don’t you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside… and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.Hey!  Why don’t you just sit down, please?We’re doing this because of you.  So why don’t you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?Why?Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.You’re right, you’re right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don’t you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let’s all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate… their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She’s a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?Ok, be more specific.What about her looks?Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.Hey!Excellent!  Good job.Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He’ll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he’ll call.  If he doesn’t, he is loco.Ugh.Wait, do we have until the end of the day?[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?We’re trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?Aww, really?I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing……was that he was a complete stupid idiot.I know.  I love Counting Crows.Wow, really?That’s a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.Ok?Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so…Is that good?OK.Darryl, would you do the honors?Nonono, no, no, I don’t want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don’t care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.No, you know what we’re gonna do?  We’re gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.Hey, Oscar!  Come on, let’s go!I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael’s office]  I want you to take Jim’s chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday.I want you to get your ass out of my face.[from his office] That’s what she said.Well…You’re…you know what?  I read in one of those books that you’re not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.I’m digging.I can’t wait to be a father.  I’m going to smother that baby.I really, I don’t want to get panty liners, please…I know, it’s…Yes.I want you to get the panty liners.",
    "Dwight": "From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.Michael, it’s time.Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can’t swallow.Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.Family only.[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]Fax this for me.It’s not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don’t see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I’ll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.Monkey. [kisses her]Let’s do this thing.OK, can you turn the girl off please? I’m trying to get some work done.Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]All right, we’re set.Shotgun weddings.Obesity-caused illnesses.Michael, we have a situation.They should not be in that room.Yeah!Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.Party’s over. You are so busted!Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.I am hardly the problem, Jim.This is what I’m gonna do.  I’m gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I’m really sorry… about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it’s a two man job.  Interested?[sighs] Sixty – forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I’ll drive.Hey, hey!And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.No, no, no, it goes, it goes… look, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”Vamping.Eh, I’ve been sitting all day.She should thank me.[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.We better.Yes, you do.I do not!  I do not say “Hi” Pam!What are you writing about me?I’m gonna write you both up for not working.Ok, well played.  Neither of us’ll write the other up for not working.[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]God.  Where is Jim?What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You’re late.Dripping on me.Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] “Here’s something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.” Can I send them a dead deer?Classy.My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.Oh, you wish.  Hellboy’s a hero.All right!Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael’s rules.Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]Will you be able to milk with those implants?Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]Okay.[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.Done.",
    "Meredith": "What should we do with all these leftovers?I like her nails.I like her fingernails.Nothing.Who gives a f[bleep]?One more kid calls me “Hellboy,” I swear to God…These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don’t think I caught anything.",
    "Stanley": "I’m taking the dumplings for my wife.I’m taking my dumplings.Oh, I forgot something in my car. I’ll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here’s what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.I lost four pounds. I don’t know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.I don’t like cake anymoreTastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.I don’t know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I’m just gonna take five days off anyway.",
    "Creed": "I can bring these to my shelter.Fright. Being scared to death.Oh nothing.That wasn’t a tapeworm.Hell of an ass.",
    "Darryl": "Don’t go breaking my scale.2,336 pounds. Y’all need to learn some portion control.All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.2,184 pounds, for a grand total — oh! You all gained five pounds back.Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.You guys lost four pounds.I say we have a parade.Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?She’s six.Okay, I’m gonna need you to make this right or else we can’t be right.",
    "Andy": "I’m excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.I’m totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.Really? ‘Cause I haven’t eaten anything since noon on Friday.Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay–Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I’m on it. I’ll see you later, love. [Dwight’s pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales:  Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney’s Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.I don’t know if there’s any one place that has all these things.Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don’t care where we get married. I’ll marry you right here in this building. I’ll marry you in the parking lot. I’ll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we’re gonna spend the rest of our lives together.[Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!Why not, dawg?Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?NO!  I want names!This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my entire life.  I haven’t had a very hard life.Leave it to me, boss.  I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It’s gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.Andy Bernard does not lose contests.  He wins them… or he quits them because they are unfair.Your wish is my command.Of course!Yeah!  I mean it’s a great song.  I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway.  You know?And you know what?  The guys already know it so it’s easy breezy.I didn’t tell you.Here Comes Treble, class of ’96 was available for our big day, so, I booked ’em.And, they are collectively my best man.  And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so… it totally works out.Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker.  But you know what?  You’re gonna love these guys.  Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that’s me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.  These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]Wet Tuna!Yeah, totally.  I’m sorry, Oscar.  Yeah, I didn’t realize it was bothering you.‘Cause it’s kind of bothering all of us, ’cause it’s really hot, you know, it’s hot, so we can lose weight, so we don’t screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I’ll turn it down.",
    "Holly": "Ex-squeeze me.Almost, Kevin.Math is hard.And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]Oh, thanks. I should check that out.Actually, I’m a lesbian.I’m not a lesbian. I don’t know why I said that… It’s a joke.There is no joke. I just said it because I haven’t had much luck lately and I’m not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.Um, I’m gonna head back to my work area and just–I knew that. OK, bye.Oh, fancy meeting you here.Wikka wikka wikka what?You’re shaking. Are you all right?Hey, Oscar. Who’s that woman in Michael’s office with the feet?Oh, she’s very beautiful.So, listen, I don’t know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.No! You do not talk to him like that!He is not an idiot!He is mentally challenged. But he’s doing a super job here.Well, no. Dwight…I’m sorry.I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?Obesity-caused illnesses.That’s so lame they didn’t invite us.Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.It’ll probably be a total disaster, but…Really?Oh, that’s sweet. Wish me luck.It’s kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we’re not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.Ok, let’s just all try and work harder, ok?Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he’s cute, right?What’s wrong?Dieting’s only half of it.And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.“…or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting—“What are you doing?Oh, I had a good time, but it’s been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so…I just got off… Kendall?  I just got off…Oh, no.No.And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?Thanks.  That’s sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That’s all that really matters.So we’re only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it’s a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.I’m calling it.  I guess that’s curtains for the yoga guy.Yeah.Yeah?Aww man, I really wanted to see them.Look at where my seats were.Yeah.Michael, you don’t have to buy them.Ok.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Okay, great.  I got it.",
    "Jim": "[smiles, looks to Michael]Really, nothing?Ah, they moved the shower.No, I didn’t. [Michael laughs] You know why?Because most of the time, friends don’t talk about other friends’ butts.But what have you learned about her?Nice.Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]I’ll just go later.So you have the directions.You have a toothbrush.You have a cell phone charger.Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.What happened?Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]Bye.Why haven’t I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um — well, we didn’t want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam’s always said she doesn’t want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I’m not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here…I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It’s because Holly is kind of a major dork.I don’t really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.All right, I am connecting and … you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications–All right!So what is going on, girl in the computer?Uh-huh.That’s not what that is.I would like to lose 65 pounds.Cryogenics. Beer me five.All right, I’m taking off.Nope, just going to see Pam.Maybe put up some shelves.OK, thank you for … this.No.[knocks on door] Hi.Oh, that’s so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam’s new art? It’s right there. Check it out. [closes door][watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam’s room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I’m in here waiting it out.Well that’s great.  [shakes Ryan’s hand] You’re talking about your court ordered community service?But he did, right?All right.Nope.Mmm.How much weight have you lost, Dwight?No, you’re definitely the problem.Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch… actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider… coworkers.Fair question.See, you’re always saying there’s something wrong with society, but… maybe there’s something wrong with you.Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I’m convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven’t seen her in 10 days.  How’s your summer?So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so…I know.  I suck.Dwight says “Hi.”Now he is saying “Hi” louder.Umm…Hey, can you go to IM?OK.I’m gonna write you up for not working.[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.Perfect.[Jim gets down on one knee]I just… couldn’t wait.Pam, will you marry me?So?Hey, sorry everybody.Hey Dwight.What’s up, Meredith?No, you’re not.[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you’re only free till three on Sunday and I can’t get there till one, then it’s gonna be pretty tight.[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father… by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] “Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news – I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don’t hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.”",
    "Kevin": "Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?Yeah.Hi Jan.How’s the candle game?Cool. Thank God they found her, too.Hey!Thank you, Holly.Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?Oh, my God![spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]Yeah.You too.Because you’re kind of doing Michael Clump.",
    "Pam": "Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not — not close to 200…Just, we’ll just keep going.Yes.Yes.I have everything.Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?I should really get going.I’m sure it was really lovely.OK, bye.No, Michael.I’m in the wrong class…Oh, no. I just–[on computer screen] I can see you!This is so cool.Lunch with a girl from my hall.Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I’m gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.Can you put me down I’m getting a little nauseous?The nerve.They’re on the supply shelf.New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city’s awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. ‘Cause– [looks toward camera]What?Really, where?Wow, was it the age difference?Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends![to friend] Nice.Sorry.You’ve already disappointed him so much.  He can’t be expecting a lot from you.I… listen, umm, we’re still good for this weekend, right?No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.OK.Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.What are you doing?Oh my God!Oh my God!Yes! [they embrace and kiss]",
    "Oscar": "All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.Hey, if you’re into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.Also — and no pressure — the teacher? He’s a catch.I’m gay!What’s the joke?Oh, you think it’s a choice?I’m messing with you, Holly.OK.Yes, she is. And clinically insane.OK.[Kelly faints] Oh!So how was your date?Oh my God, what happened?Because it’s your making-fun-of-fat-people character.I think of him as more like… a monster?  What about, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”How was Friday night?He’ll call.[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin.
