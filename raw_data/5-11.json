    "Pam": "[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I’m sorry, he’s not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It’s actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.Quick announcement:new year, new candy.Okay, be careful, Kevin. They’re kind of spicy.Yeah.So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it’s okay, have a couple more…Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.Of course you will.Oh my God!",
    "Michael": "[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!No. No, no. There was wind.Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.Go, Oscar. Thirty-one’s my number.Beat it!Today’s a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I’ll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so… probably bad.Wait, you still don’t know…You still don’t know.[to Jim] What are you doing?Andy.[from inside his office] No, what I’m saying is…No, that’s not it.[sighs] How can he still not know?I can’t take it anymore.I am telling Andy.Who should it come from, then?[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’]Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’]Well?You know this can’t go on.We have to put an end to this.Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael’s office]When will she be ready?Is she crazy in bed?How so, specifically?Really?It’s too late.I am already walking.Okay, what does that mean?[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?Walk with me.Ohh, I do not have much time… car’s all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say… say these things, that… are bad things… that you hear… in your ears… this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn’t want to hear…Well… no, I’m not. So I… I’m not very articulate today, so I’ll just leave it for another time. Another day.Which will be fine. I am off!Thank you! [gets into his car][through the car window] Okay. I will… Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so…[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They’ve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.Yep. [drives off]Right what?David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don’t ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter… where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or… or where you’ve been… ever. For any reason, whatsoever.Sometimes I’ll start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it’s cooler.[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I’ve never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, “Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?” And he looks at me and he says, “Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.” And I look back at him and I say, “I feel the need!… The need for tweed.”[rises] Oh, thank you.I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.Okay. [sits back down to continue eating]Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here’s an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!",
    "Dwight": "[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!Yes!I was just jogging.Wait, what?  You can’t take what?No. You can’t do that. It shouldn’t come from you.[coolly] Seems like you already know where.[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.I’ve got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.[grabs a spoon from Jim’s coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.Rule 17:don’t turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don’t, you’ll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound][moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela’s attention]You’ve got to tell Andy about us.Get it over with. Then we don’t have to hide anymore.Do you love me or not?Because you’re engaged to Andy.Not yet.Angela said she was going to tell him. She’s just not ready.I don’t know.[boastfully] Yes.Eager.And flexible.Michael, once this gets out… I don’t know how it’s going to go down.Might get ugly.[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.If I’m sitting, I can’t disable his neck or his groin.If I’m sitting, I don’t have the option to.Andy.Oh good. She broke up with you.Uh, no way. I am not giving up.No I don’t.[angrier] Well I don’t know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.Will never be her name.I don’t think so.And I’m telling you that I will never back down.Oh really? How are you gonna do that?That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.Fine!What is your weapon?Hey, this is none of your business.Yes!Outside of work.None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.Mm.[innocently] How’d that get there?[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let’s do this thing! Come on! Come on out!Come on!Where are you?Come on, coward! Where are you? Where… [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] “From the desk of Andrew Bernard.” [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. “Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.” True. “The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly…” [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly][still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation…Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!Never! [hits Andy’s car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!You’re not a man! You don’t know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] “La la la la la la la la la la!” What does that mean? You can’t even protect her!Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]No. My right one’s falling asleep a little bit.Yeah, back off. This isn’t your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]I sa- [Andy honks his horn]Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!What?She’s sleeping with you?She said she was only sleeping with me.[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can][as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]",
    "Phyllis": "Wow, thirteen!Why isn’t Dwight turning around?Andy’s running over Dwight with his car.",
    "Jim": "No, no, no, it’s not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.Nothing.Why don’t… Let’s…How about we just… Just have to talk to you for a second…Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]No, no.I know.Andy still doesn’t know that Angela’s having an affair with Dwight. And it’s been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he’ll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it’s just… awkward.We can’t figure that out.No.Please stop.When?This is really not how this is supposed to happen.Stop. What?Okay, listen.This shouldn’t happen at work.And!This shouldn’t be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.Well it’s not too late, because you haven’t done anything.But you’re leaving…[to Dwight] What are you standing for?You’re not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.Dwight, I’m in charge when Michael’s gone, and I need you to sit…You okay, man?Hey guys, why don’t we, uh, just cool off a bit?Nope.Okay, you know what? That’s enough. Because…Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day… leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.[collects Dwight’s weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]Thanks Meredith.Dwight! Are your legs broken?Andy, are you all right?",
    "Stanley": "There was a car.What’s happening?",
    "Oscar": "Thirty-one is humanly impossible.That’s impossible.What is wrong with you? She is engaged.Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘at your desk’; Oscar’s voice breaks] Where, Dwight?That was good… It’s just, at the end you weren’t saying something that could also apply to the form.There you go.You said that yesterday.This is nuts.Mm-mm. It’s 4:10, I don’t think he’s gonna show.The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.",
    "Kevin": "Whoo-hoo!Hot tamales.Uh oh.Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would’ve admitted it, and stopped right away.Because I wouldn’t want an innocent person, who doesn’t know anything about the form… [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?How about, “I’m sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?”We’re not listening.Oh come on, man! Believe in something.",
    "Andy": "[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It’s kind of the elephant in the room, so I’ll just… [sighs] No one has RSVP’ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.Hmm?No, no one has RSVP’ed, and I don’t understand it, and now, you’re shutting me out. You’re not even listening. That’s really considerate. Thank you.[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You’re going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I’m saying is, I want to cut it myself…When what? [clears throat] When what?What can’t go on?Seems like…You guys should… be hearing what I’m saying.Yeah.Will do, boss-man.You’re not making any sense.All righty.Have a good meeting![through the car window] Kick Wallace’s ass!I can’t hear you through the glassWhat?Are you serious?[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.I need to talk to you in private.Let’s go to the conference room.Is it true?That you’re sleeping with Dwight.Is it true?Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?How long has it been going on?Who else knows about it?Who else?Oh God. Come on!So like, missionary…Do you love him?Why should I believe that?Who says that?Where’s Dwight?No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what’s been going on this entire time.[Dwight enters] Dwight.It’s over.No. It’s over between you two.You have to.[forcefully] She doesn’t love you. She’s marrying me.Angela Bernard.It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!I’m telling you to back down.Then I’ll make you.Through the use of force.I will fight you.Fine!Guess what? Not happening at work.We’re gonna do it outside.None of your business.My bare hands.Then I’ll get something too.I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.[softly] What a coincidence.Yeah.You give up?I am a man! I’m a bigger man than you’ll ever be! I would never sleep with another man’s fiance!Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When’s the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?Go away, Tuna! I’m winning this!What did you say? I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You’re like, you’re like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods…I don’t get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?What!I’m her fiance.[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat… Yep, that’s the one.Thank you. [hangs up]",
    "Everyone": "[simultaneously] Angela.",
    "Angela": "Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.That’s enough.What is it?That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.You’re expanding on your worst idea.I’ve already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?[sighs]We can talk right here.What have you heard?That doesn’t sound like me.Andy, I’m engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn’t want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake…A little bit.I don’t know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and… I don’t know exactly when we started up again.Michael.[quietly] Let me think about it… I, um… there… [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.I said nothing fancy.I love you.Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we’re not good together.Or, we can prove them wrong. Let’s prove them wrong.[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.[watching from the conference room] I can’t believe they’re gonna fight over me.",
    "Meredith": "I knew something bad was gonna happen today.Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.I’ve had two men fight over me before. Usually it’s over which one gets to hold the camcorder.I call loser!There’s a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.Hey, has anything happened yet?",
    "David": "So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don’t know exactly how to put this, but… what are you doing right?Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you’re not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing… is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.Here’s the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It’s not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It’s Hail Mary time.What say we do.It’s hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.Yes.Yeah.[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.",
    "Creed": "You are welcome.Yeah.",
    "Kelly": "I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.There’s Andy, he’s in his car. You guys, what is he doing?",
    "Everyone watching": "Oh!"
