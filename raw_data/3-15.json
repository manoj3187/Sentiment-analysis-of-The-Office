    "Jim": "Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I’ve been conducting a similar experiment.[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?What are you doing?What?So what’s in the box?Those flowers are nice.Phyllis and Robert.You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.Did you ever see that movie?You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.Hey.When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.I know. It’s very cute.Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then… No, it’s totally hypothetical.Here’s a ‘not hypothetical’. I’m really happy I’m with Karen.",
    "Dwight": "What do you think?Okay.SureInbwit? Yes.[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]I…I don’t know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]Hello, Angela.You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?No way.Of course I saw it.I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That’s the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won’t have to get her a gift.It’s a miracle.Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I’m going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.Dammit, Phyllis!‘Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?The bride and groom? What are their names?Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let’s move it. Come on. Come on.Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.I can’t let you in, Michael.No, it’s Bob and Phyllis’ orders.You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I’m sorry, it gives me no pleasure.",
    "Michael": "Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father’s wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I’m paying for the wedding. Which I’m happy to do. It’s a big day for Phyllis. But it’s an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.How you doin’? You excited.Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?You’re probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It’s okay, if you did. It’s a very natural reaction. It’s your wedding. And you’re nervous…Okay… umm… I’m sure that Bob… Wow. That is… that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah… Are you set on that hairstyle?Here, let me…Just cover up that bald patch.Okay.You might be surprised to learn that I’ve only been to one other wedding. It’s actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!Long story short: Jeff’s dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said ‘boo’.This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis’ father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies’ man, aren’t you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can’t believe I’m actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let’s do it.[whispers to father] That’s ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]This is bull****!Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now… the wedding has no highlight.I can’t believe I pushed that… that guy’s lazy ass around all day… until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That’s… well… I got news for you, Albert. If that’s your real name. The show’s not over.Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!Oh, shiii…Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!Congratulations, Bob. You’re a good man. But just know… if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?I’m already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.I will take care of that.I do. I know a fair amount about fine food… and drink. This is a white.Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I’m Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I’m going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster’s Dictionary defines “wedding” as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Michael Scott, Phyllis’ boss. To quote from The Princess Bride “Mawige…The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her… and she’s kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was ‘Easy Rider’. Now as for Bob… Bob Vance…is a guy that…he works… Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn’t say anything when Phyllis’ dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.No. I’m not going to…Ok. All right.Oh. Yeah. You’re out of here! You’re… Yeah. I hate you!Come… Come on!Dwight, just…Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I’m not even going to dance one song.OK.[sings] ee… I was meant for you… buppity du bom bu.I just want Phyllis to have a great day.We are great together. We are a great team.Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don’t want this to ruin her honeymoon.Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I’m sorry. I just… I just wanted to make this a day to remember.Yeah. Yeah. He’s kind of a weirdo.You’re… You’re welcome.They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that’s crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other’s face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]",
    "Photographer": "Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let’s bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.",
    "Phyllis": "Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.Thanks, Michael. That’s sweet.

    "Stanley": "A toaster, you?Unbelievable.",
    "Karen": "A toaster.Yeah. P and R?Ah, of course.[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every…",
    "Angela": "Hi, Dwight.Thank you. Don’t linger. Break left. Left!Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.",

    "Roy": "Hey.I know I normally don’t notice these kind of things but uh… This wedding’s really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff?
