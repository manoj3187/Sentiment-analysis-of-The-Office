    "Michael": "And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They’re just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And… when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn’t have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.We have a lot of colored paper here… why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It’s bland.Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a “Where’s Waldo.” [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen][everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let’s quit while we’re ahead.That was awesome. Thank you.Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?Oh, does he?Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.And… today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it’s birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP’s, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City’s finest, and I do not mean policemen…The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.No.  It doesn’t.  I’ll find out tonight.What’s that, pipsqueak?Ohh, lunch party.Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.Okay.Really?It’s the European cut.Umm… hey.  Ah, what’s hanging?Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?I had um, one of those danishes.Why don’t you wanna go tonight?  What… all your friends are gonna be there.  It’ll be fun.Just…Yeah.Thank you.Na… no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I’m a big loser.Do I have your permission to invite Carol?I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  It’s just the first… girl that popped into my head.  I’ll find somebody I haven’t slept with.So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.Just let me know who the winner is.Alright.  I’m ready to go and I’m callin’ shotgun.Yes.  Thank you.Oh yeah, you’d better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.  [kissing noise, kissing noise]  I love ya Pam… okay.  [singing]  I’m leavin’ inside Jim’s car, I don’t know when I’ll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I’ll be back.  I’ll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um… yeah.  So you know what?  Why don’t you guys take off a little bit early tonight?If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You’ll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured…Same sort of stuff in here.Mmwa.  Mmwa.Leaving Pennsylvania.One for me one for Jan.You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That’d be fun.  Friday?Wanna come over Friday?After work you guys…Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It’s a club called Chatroom, and there’s a password to get in, which is actually password.  So…What are you doing?No.No, I’m sure that’s not.  Na…Yes.Well the invitation says VIP’s only.  Is this how you treat your VIP’s, Ryan?  We’re already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I’m going to throw up.  I’m throwing up.  You’re making me throw up, Ryan.You know what this is like?  I’ll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn’t let any of the Seniors go.Doesn’t it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?Yeah.  I withdrew too.Alright who wants to party?Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you’ve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody’s gonna come.  What’s wrong with Dwight?Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I’d like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn’t as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I’m not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.How we doing on time?Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.Mmmhmm.Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important…YesUh…I want it…I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, “Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?”Yes you can.Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn’t say that if I didn’t hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don’t have a lot of time.  I’ll get the pizza!Good news.Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?Same thing.You know what?  I don’t understand when you all talk at the same time.Pizza by Alfredo.Okay, okay, what’s better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?[sighs, walks back into office]Yup.You don’t have to say it like that.HeyRight, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.You didn’t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?Okay, it doesn’t say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it’s policy, it should say it on the coupon.[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?It is your problem.  That’s no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.I’m not giving that to you.No, no you’re not going anywhere.  You’re staying here until we figure this out.You know what?  This young man needs to learn that’s not how you treat people.  I don’t care if it’s pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don’t just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.No, you don’t even know what stupid is.  It’s about to get all stupid up in here.You ready to give me my discount now?Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.No!  I’m an adult, I don’t have to think or do anything.  You’re a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he’s better than everyone else, because he’s some hot shot, and you don’t know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that’s called sales.Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.Stop talking all at once!Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.I’m not kidnapping him, I’m keeping him until I get what I want.I think you’re over-thinking it.Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I’m keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our…Trouble.  Okay, alright.He said no.No, no.Mister Overdramatic, what’s up Kevin?I’ll just wave and introduce myself.Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.Hey, have you seen Jim?Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.I could have paid for the pizza.Oh my God, oh my God.This is Michael.You’re breaking up. I can’t hear you.[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.I will open the door.And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.Yes.See ya, drive safely.[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.Not now Dwight, please, it’s not the time.What a horrible day.Bluh.Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I’d really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?I’m going to get it.Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.New York.  Wanna go?Alright, you drive.Here we go.Mmm.Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let’s go.Guilty.Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.Yeah.[mocking Ryan] I’m Ryan, and tonight didn’t go the way that I thought it would, because it didn’t work out for me, and I’m very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.I never sold any paper, because I’m an idiot.I made it with my cheese pita.I started a fire, I started a fire.And I’m hot, I’m so hot. That’s why everybody…Well, it’s part of it, it’s just the… uhhh.Wanna head back?What’s wrong with me?I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don’t avoid this.  I know you’re dying to say it, so just say it.What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn’t see it at home, I didn’t see it in the bathroom, I didn’t see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light…The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can’t go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?Really?That’s it?All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart’s receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin’ it.  Nn… no.[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?",
    "Jim": "There’s this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it’s heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.[to Pam] Wait for it.Hey Meredith, how you feelin’?Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so…Haha…Uh-huh.MmmHmm…Oh yeah.Alright…Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?Actually it sounds like you are.Or zipadeedoodaah.I was… mocking.Or a gong.Really?  Power gel?What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?What?Yeah, I’m aware of that.  But he’s also being super annoying.  And I’m not a perfect person.[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.Sure we’ll go.Oh I’m sorry.  What?Nope.Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.How’s it going?Yeah?You look a little worried.Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.Hey man.What’s going on?Oh yeah?I’m driving?Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.Yeah.It’s not.  It’s different.  But it’s a good book.What was that?Oh.  Two kisses.Gotcha.That would be fun.Uhhh.  Can’t.Oh, no cause… you’re gonna let me know when we’re close, right?Mmmkay…Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.Yep.Are there, uh, three w’s at the beginning of the address?Yep.Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.You need to let him go.Yes.Yes, but not by kidnapping.As a hostage.I think you’re under-thinking it.Ransom.What did he say?So, we should let him go.Okay.Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?Okay.What have we got here?Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?Which one’s this? Perfect.Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?And that’s when I knew. You?That was the moment that you knew you liked me?Wow, can we make it a different moment?A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.Well it’s just that you had no hair on Friday.How long have you been a man?That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.",
    "Pam": "I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn’t see it?  Did Jim say that I didn’t see it? I saw it!Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.He does.Dwight mercy killed Angela’s cat.  It’s very complicated.  It’s caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.He’s going through a break-up.What kind of prank are you thinking?Yes it’s too tight.Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.Uh, just one second.  We’re in a meeting and I’ll see if he’s available.  It’s Jan.One of the tickets is for him.I won.Tie goes to the girlfriend.Here’s a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don’t you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.Hello.Um… uh… I’ll get back to you.The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.I said it normal.Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.I’m all over it.Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you’re never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there’s no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you’re about to eat has expired.Yep.Nope.Ah-ha.Excuse me?Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the…?The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?Put cold tea bags on your eyes.Yeah.Mmhmm.",
    "Andy": "Dah!  Come on!And this is where I will record your sales.And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.I can’t tell if he’s mocking me.Ehh, can’t do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.Thank you.Yes like a chime or a bell…Yes!Twenty seconds to go time.[blowing air horn] Yeah!Website check please.Three-oh-five.  You my friend are winning handsomely.You my friend are in a very close second.Okay, uh why don’t you just lay off, lady?No !  [blows air horn and dances]Four!  Three!  Two!  One!Woo!After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it’s path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.Fifty-two reams!Dwight has defeated the computer.He beat the computer.What do you think of Angela?No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.You hadn’t noticed she’s a woman?I hear she’s single and ready to mingle.  I’m thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?Isn’t that part of the fun?She works here too, how is that any different?[raised eyebrows] Okay.Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you’re not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an “are you kidding me?” look]Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.Angela, are you hearing words that I’m saying?Hello.They say you should never mix business with pleasure.  Really?  Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.Yes I will.Excuse me.I stole it!You said your upper back itched.Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I’ve repulsed you, but I like you.So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she’s giving off fairly strong vibes that she’s not interested.But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can’t back down.[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second.  Hello, hang on.[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I’ll be first in line.  Honey, I’m still free, take a chance on me.  If you need me let me know, gonna be around.  If you got no place to go, if you’re feeling down.  If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I’m still free, take a chance on me.  Gonna do my very best, and that ain’t no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try.  Take a chance on me, that’s all I ask of you Angela.  Take a chance on me.I don’t know yet, I have to call you back.I’ll call you back.[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There’s just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.No.  I will not be playing it “cool” [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here’s the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.",
    "Oscar": "It’s never gonna happen.This is why I’m here?Why aren’t you in New York?Michael, there’s a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?It’s not pizza.Stanley, could you look up “accomplices”?Because we’re looking up jail time.Thank God.I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela’s party is mandatory.Don’t.You know the octagon sign means stop.An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can’t you?",
    "Kevin": "Dude, you gotta believe.That was so awesome.Isn’t 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?Maybe you could just change the U into an A.Wait! Alfredo’s Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?No, no.Oscar, talk to him.Oh no, it’s bad.  It’s real bad.  It’s like eating a hot circle of garbage.We think it’s a straight forward kidnapping.What’s going on?We’re getting hungry out there.  We’re all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo’s Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.Good pizza.Different stuff.I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.I’m a little mad, that I don’t get to go to the party in New York.  But that’s mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person’s will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor…In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don’t know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.",
    "Everyone": "Oh! Yes!",
    "Meredith": "Hey… there he is.I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.Well, I really appreciate you coming. I’m singling you ouuuut.Anyway, I have this Sharpie…And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?[whispers] I’ll read this when I get home.Three hundred and five.Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.Four-oh-two.What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.I think it looks good.Angela, what kind of music?How am I supposed to know what that is?",
    "Dwight": "That’s ridiculous.  I’m not going to be beaten by a website.Really?  ‘Cause Ryan says so?I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.You believe a computer can beat me?Well I will prove you wrong.We’ll see.Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.Just ignore him.I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.Got it.  Carb up.Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.Today I’m prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.Three reams! Yoohoo… in your face, machines.What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I’ll hold.It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.Ohhhhhh!No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I’m suggesti… you did what?  Ah no!  That’s exactly what you’re not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]Fine.  Good.Yeah.I do not look worried.What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!Return it!  Return it now!Y… You don’t understand. If… okay, if this makes the difference, I’m gonna tell it that you were responsible.I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you’re paying right now?  It’s not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.I’m sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I… yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women’s shelter?Huh?!Did you see the board?Yes!Woo!Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.No no no the first part.Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.You didn’t have to.I think she’s efficient.I hadn’t noticed.[impatient sigh]I think it’s inappropriate to date someone you work with.No.  I think you should date Kelly.Uh, she works in the annex.  You’re also welcome to date Toby.I’ve seen this kid before. He’s one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.We’re a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.What did you just call him?What did you say?I can make him talk, Michael.Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don’t like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.Hey!It’s just ice, it’ll melt all over the floor.[smiles][kicks open bathroom door] If you’re going number one you’ve got ten more seconds!Ahh-chaa!I’m just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you’re going to do something to him.Shut up, or I’m going to punch you in the throat!You had to, what other choice did you have?Well, yeah.What will you do?Yeah.So, I’m paying full price?Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There’s two more.Now what?Alright.  Oh, I assume I’m going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.Blah.Uhh.What?Coopers has calamari.Tokyo?Yes.Okay.Nice.Woo-hoo.Yum.Later on.And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.I started a fire with my cheese pita.I date Indian girls.Now I’ve got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I’m your boss.I don’t get that, I don’t understand that.Yeah, let’s go.[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?It’s called being a man.  You should try it sometime.I was born a man, Halpert.I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I’ll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I’m in pain.Hey.  The way I see it, it’s getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend’s pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that’s how it’s gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I’ve done it before.",
    "Kelly": "If that’s from Ryan, does it mention if he’s seeing anybody?Waaay too tight.Why is it so tight?Depends… how much have you eaten already today?You had carbs?  That’s awful.But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, “Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.”Thanks.Not so much anymore.Is that traffic school?Because we’re not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.Just reiterating what you said to me.",

It’s supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.It is awful.  You’ve made this day awful!Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?It’s supposed to say launch!I care!Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here’s $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who’ll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat’s still dead.Is just looks bad.I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?Goodie.Because there’s a party! A party for the website I’ve been planning for two weeks.Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!There’s still an hour.I didn’t ask you to do it for me.How do you tell someone it’s over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?Hello, Pam.Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.Let me know.Thank you.The party starts in an hour.Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?Something made of ice?Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?Chocolates?  Someone famous?Cool music.Confetti.Go-Go dancers?I can’t do this.I can’t do it.It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.Ow!What?I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I’ve got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there’s no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that’s made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it’s itched all day, and I can’t reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.I have to hang these.I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.That’s why you’re not in charge Meredith.How did you, um, where did you…Will you help me put it over there?Okay.Ow! What are you doing?I didn’t ask you to scratch it.I’m not dating you.I have to go clean up after the party.Uh… something cool that Ryan doesn’t know about yet.I don’t know, but standing here’s not going to give you the answer.  Go.Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm’s party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d’oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair’s naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.",
    "Phyllis": "Stanley, you’re dancing!Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we’re gonna try out some new things today.So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?I’m so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.I want to understand what you’re saying but it’s difficult for me when you use that tone.Yes.You can pick one of these things.

We’re takin’ it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don’t want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin’ paper just became fun.And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.Always a jokester.  How about that image?

    "Angels": "Okay.  Okay.",
    "All": "[murmurs of approval][disagreeing with Michael][shouts of disapproval]Medium amount of good pizza.Michael, Michael",

    "Creed": "I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He’s a mole person.",

[smiles] It didn’t work.Damn it.Yeah.Yeah.I remember.Thanks Kelly.Colorblind.It’s out of context.  It’s not the same as driving."
