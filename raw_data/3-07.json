    "Karen": "Hey.Who are you faxing so early in the morning?Hey, um… did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is… [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]What you gonna do?You know, I’m fine. I’ll be better when I know if I have a job.Yeah, if they let me, I think I… I think I would.Yeah, you know… I might do that. I, who knows? I… I might do that.Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.Yeah, I’m happy he said that. I mean, I don’t think he’s into me or anything, but, I’m kind of into him. So…there you go.",
    "Jim": "Hey.Oh, umm… kinda hard to explain.I don’t have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight’s stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] “Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.”Really? Wow… that’s bad.Well, I work here now.I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it’s going to be weird that it’s all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.Hey, do you have a second?I know it’s not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who’s coming over here from Scranton?Okay, so is it like sales or… accountants?What does that mean?Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.Wow.Thank you.No, it’s just I’m not sure if I um… well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um…No. No, no. Just um… some personal stuff. And I’m not really ready to revist that, I don’t think.Okay.I really don’t know.  How you doing with all this?You’d actually move to Scranton?New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I’d move to New York?Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton… it’s not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.Okay.",
    "Dwight": "No![knocks coffee out of Stanley’s hand.] You’ll thank me later.Hey stranger.Sorry. I just feel like we haven’t talked in awhile.Yes!What’s the plan?Can I drive?Shotgun!Still.Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won’t be coming back into the office.But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.Christmas card list.But when I do, we’ll have something to talk about.So, do you know what you’re gonna say when he shows up?No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I’ll be him, you be you. Let’s practice.[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum… coming home from work.Yes? What is the meaning of this?Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It’s simple dollars and cents.Listen, Scott… we’re losing money, okay? It’s not a charity; it’s a business. And it’s a dying business.[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?Okay.[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do… coming home from work…[frightened] Uh!Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.[referring to Michael’s ringing phone] who is it?Gonna get it?Nothing. [puts down binoculars]Then it was an honor to have worked with you.My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.Uh,… my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.What were your favorite moments?What about when Jan said the branch was closing?Well, it doesn’t…[picks up his beeping cell phone][on the phone] Oh my God!Stranford is closed! Michael, we’re not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.We did it!In your face!Oh, man.I don’t … have no idea.",
    "Michael": "There she is – Jan Levinson. First……thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.Yes.I don’t understand.On whom’s authority?What?You’re welcome.Am I a small number person or a severance package person?Oh… [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don’t really get it ’cause we’re not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.Well…Oh, you gotta be… Josh?Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?It is an outrage, that’s all. It’s… hey’re making a huge, huge mistake. Let’s see Josh replace these people. Let’s see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don’t. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley’s daughter from Stanley’s desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.Don’t say that. That just sounds weird. Please.Well… we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work … while you still can.Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.Nothing. Just checking in. I can’t tell you, so…Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We’ll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.What?Do I have any messages?Ok, ok…[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody… I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.You knew about this all along, didn’t you?Traitor. You are a traitor.I don’t know. Probably not. This is the worst.Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs]I know, I know. Well, I’ll land on my feet. Don’t worry about me.So, you’ll be okay too. You’re a warrior. You’re smart, capable. You’ll find something else and…Awesome.This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let’s go.Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he’s making a mistake… save the branch.No… way.No. There’s no one else.Okay, okay. Um…Why?You sent him cards? You never met him.Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO’s house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he’s like “Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You’re a bad person.” It’s very dramatic.  Although, I can’t say I was a big fan of  ‘Bowling for Columbine’, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like ‘Kingpin’. And it wasn’t. It was something else.I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.All right.Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop… stop it! Just, okay. He’s not going to say any of that.Because he’d be intimidated and I, just… let’s start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?Don’t touch me this time.Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]The office.No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.Anything?What if this doesn’t work? What is the office actually goes under?[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.That was hilarious. The foam …Oh, right. Okay, that’s enough. That’s good.Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.God, Dwight!What are we still doing here? It’s over. Let’s go home. Get the car.Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody’s jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!What?!We did it? We did it.Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight’s]Yeah, baby!We did it!How did we do it?I don’t understand.",
    "Jan": "Michael.Michael.Michael.I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.The board voted last night to close your branch.The board’s.I’m very sorry. I don’t relish telling you this. You’ve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.Well, we haven’t made final decisions about personnel yet. But you’re a severance package person.Well, it’s not all about numbers, Michael.It’s… it’s about talent.Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company’s future.Hi.Oh, good. You’re both here. Ready to talk logistics?So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you’ll be his number two.Awesome.Wha… excuse… why not?Today?You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I…I’m gonna make some calls.So… we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.Yeah.Michael.Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.[in Scranton] Where’s Michael?[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha… what’s going on here?Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I’m sure there is a better way to do this but I’ve drive something like 400 miles today and I’m completely exhausted so I’m just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is… and tell him.Back?Uh, we don’t know. Probably. A few.",
    "Dwight ": "When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael’s book is, “Something Weird is Going On.” Colon, “What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.”",
    "Andy": "Um, sorry… the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!Mmmm.. suck-ah![surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut![after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What’s up, Josh?Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.",
    "Pam": "Are you okay?What did Jan want?What can’t you tell me?What?!You just said that we’re gonna be gone…?Michael, what’s going on?It’s a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, “Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.” So, maybe that’ll stop now.Oh, good… you’re bringing Dwight.He’s not here. I don’t know where he is.Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?Sure, uh, Jan… um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.That’s, um… I hadn’t thought about it, huh.Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs… so, good news, right?No thanks, guys.Have fun though.Really? Where did you hear that?Okay.Yeah.Yeah, me too.Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There’s another annoying boss, another desk, I’d have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",
    "Toby": "Michael, uh… we shouldn’t be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I’m 65.",
    "Angela": "What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?I don’t want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone’s to blame.I don’t want to go all the way to Dunmore.No seafood.Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?No.Yes!",
    "Ryan": "It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I’m gonna go someplace else and you’re gonna go someplace else. It just doesn’t make sense.This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael’s gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it’s for the best.Is Jim coming back.I just don’t want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.Oh, yeah, totally.Uh yeah, we’ll meet you there.",
    "Kelly": "If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I’m so happy we don’t have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!",
    "Stanley": "I couldn’t be happier. I’m gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn’t be happier.",
    "Roy": "What does that mean?I don’t really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, “You Don’t Know What You Got (Till It’s Gone)”? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it… in words.Crazy day, huh?Yeah, man! I’m uh… I’m really glad you’re still gonna be working here.",
    "Kevin": "Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.Where are we going?How about Cugino’s?How ’bout Cooper’s then?But, I don’t want to go to DJ’s.Hooters?Yes! [hugs Angela]Hey Pam, we’re going to Poor Richards. Creed’s buying shots.All right.Cool.[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?Awesome. Let’s go, Phyllis.",
    "Darryl": "Hey Mike.Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.I wasn’t.Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he’s keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.",
    "Josh": "Sure, what’s up?I honestly don’t. I don’t know.You know what, Jim, I wouldn’t worry about it.Jan, hey.Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.Excuse me, Jan, I’m sorry… I’m gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.[nods][sighs]I’m sorry, all right? It’s done, it’s done.Hey Andy!I just want to say thanks. Good luck.",
    "M ichael": "Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?",
    "Michael ": "Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?",
    "Phyllis": "Hey guys. Uh, I’m trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we’re never gonna see each other again.I thought maybe DJ’s.Okay, forget it. [walks away]We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.Stanley! [hugs Stanley]Hey, I hear Jim’s coming back.I was…[to Pam] I’ll tell you later.",
