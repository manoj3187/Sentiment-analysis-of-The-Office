    "Kelly": "Here you go.It’s not a dress. It’s a kurta.You look so handsome.I know.I…I don’t get why you won’t go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.Well, go with Dwight. He’s single, too. Right?Um… Diwali is awesome… and there’s food… and there’s going to be dancing… and… Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um…Sparkles…Oh, um… I don’t know. It’s really old, I think.Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.Don’t even listen to them. They’re so…I don’t even want to hear it. Okay. I didn’t come this Diwali to get yelled at!Uh… excuse me. I want to get a…Um, well, basically, it’s like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there’s a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?Like, an Indian Halloween?Um, customer service.What? I’m not Muslim!She’s so wonderful.",
    "Michael": "Nice dress, Ryan.[laughing] OK.Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it’s ada blah blah blah, it’s so super fun and it’s going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.How come you didn’t get me one?Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do… sign me up… because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.It’s important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.Wha? Really? You should! It’s fun.I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di… don’t really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don’t want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I’m a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.Kelly?Um… why don’t you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn’t ‘Lord of the Rings’.Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that’s true, but it’s also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. ‘The Village’, ‘Unbreakable’, ‘Sixth Sense’, ‘Sig… ‘Okay. Spoiler… alert.Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What’s the… oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?And another thing about the Indian people… they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who’s seen that before?Thank you, Kevin.Well, I find it beautiful.No…No, You’re not going to collect them.No. This is delightful, charming culture.My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It’s just sex. People… everybody does it. I’m doing it… with Carol! Probably tonight.[points at woman] What does that look like to you?No one’s even going to notice.Hey, Kevin. It’s a costume. Why don’t you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.I’ll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions…Oh, yuck. [spits out food]No. These s’mores are disgusting.Do you think they have any s’mores?All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?Wow.Oh! She’s not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um… no, we’re not married… yet!She is. Very fair and very kind. So… um… tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It’s still very cool. Ok. Thanks!I’m going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I’m just going to get this for a sec… just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um… everyone? I’m sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah… Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um… okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you’re all thinking ‘who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?’ Well, I’m not crazy. Maybe I’m crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.What do you say?I didn’t hear you. [laughs][lowers microphone] Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Okay.No. I get it. I get it. You’re not ready. We’ll wait. This is a classic…Yeah, well, but I … I feel like I’ve known you many lifetimes. Maybe I’m Hindu after all. Okay, I’m not Hindu, but… Carol. Carol, I just… I feel like… I just like you so much.Yes.Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don’t I come with you. Cause I’ve got this book called the Kama Sutra.All right. Good night.Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.That’s so spicy.Oh. You waiting for a call?Wow. Pam. When Carol said ‘No.’ tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.I was in that marriage arena, though.Yeah. Uuuuh… well.We’re so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]What are you doing?I’m… what? I didn’t[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?These are not my shoes. This is just like that show ‘Taxi Cab Confessions’.Sorry.This is going out to Indians everywhere. It’s a tribute to one of the greats… Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it’s time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it’s not Christmas, it’s Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don’t invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you’re Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!How do I explain this to Jan?Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?Hello, Jan.Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.What is Diwali?You don’t know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I’m surprised. It’s the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you’d be familiar with it. It’s the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It’s like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween——rolled into one.I bet you’re not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in…… customer service is a Hindu person.And.Yeah.You do?Oh, I dunno about that.For Kelly, that seems a bit much.[hangs up]Yeah, you should see her naked.I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she’s allergic to hay. So I said, “Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,” and she’s like “I don’t like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.”  And I’m like, “Well you’re really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.” And she’s like, “What the hell are you talking about?” And I’m like, “I’m kidding. I didn’t put a roof…” [cracks himself up] … We laughed so hard… It was hilarious… oh… [calms down] So yes, I’m very excited about the Diwali party.And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.Yeah?So, any questions?",
    "Pam": "Really you do. I love the material.I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.I just feel kind of tired, you know.Maybe. I just …I don’t really have anyone to go with.Very official.I decided to come. Uh… I feel a little under-dressed… but at least I’m not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?It’s hot in there. How’s the naan?I am. You should come dance with us.No one.Here. [hands drink]Yeah.Uh… no.Well, you were never really engaged.Yeah.I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.What are you doing?I’m rejecting your……kiss.If you sit in the back.You say one more word; I’m stopping the car.[on phone] Michael, you’re on with Jan.Michael?Your shirt is buttoned wrong.",

It’s a disease! I’ve told you.Nice outfit.For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and… Better yet, I’ll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It’ll save us both on postage.Excellent.",

    "Angela": "Don’t go. They eat monkey brains.How many gods do you have?[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal?

What can I eat?I’ll just have some bread. You used your hands.Dry. You look like you were having fun.I have to watch our shoes so they don’t get stolen. Who were you texting?",
