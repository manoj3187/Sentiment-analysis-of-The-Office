    "Jim": "[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.Here we go. [Meredith’s phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]Kev, c’mon.[whispering] Would you please stop that?You’re breathing very heavily.No it’s not.Oh no. I was just –… Yes.I’ve never been a kiss up. I – it’s just not how I operate. I mean, I’ve always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.Uh, no. Nope. Not really.It’s ’cause I’m more of a player.You bet.Well I do.I play.Well, maybe you should get back to work.Maybe we will someday.Yeah.Let’s… eh… see ya.Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.Oh, there he goes.Yikes.Aw, man.Oh! Goal!Aw, it’s gonna be the [softly] worst.Left.Forward, definitely.Striker!Alright! Let’s do it.Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]What?Okay, I’m just gonna go get some ice.I’m sorry, Phyllis.",
    "Kevin": "Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!Please hold.

Just, day-to day.[laughing at something on his computer]Oh. Oh my God. I’m so embarrassed. You weren’t supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.No way!I hate soccer. But guess who doesn’t hate soccer? Charles Miner.Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!Cool!Whoa! And he just goes, “Boom”. [kicking motion] Goal!You know your soccer, man.I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but…I’m in it to win.Get ‘im, Jim! C’mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]",
    "Dwight": "Hustle!Way to go.What?This is how I breathe.If you want to tell me –Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. ‘Cause you never, ever talk about it.Wow.You can be so modest sometimes.Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.I don’t try and be anything that I’m not.Jim, what do you say?Game on!Wing.Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?",
    "Angela": "You’re bad at this too!Charles, where were you born?Sounds fun.",
    "Stanley": "Just transfer the damn call.I don’t think he even uses the bathroom.I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh… Diego Maradona.From Argentina.",
    "Pam": "Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we’re starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it’s official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]Michael, you were expecting me, right?Are you wearing anything under the robe?This looks great, Michael.Yes, please.… Square is fine.So, what do you say we get started?I’m full.I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.Yeah. I’m excited to start the company.We did that. So, what’s next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.No, I know you are.Just let me have… Oh.Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed –I know! No, I’m saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.I think you should get dressed.Michael, that seems impossible.We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.Great.No. What? Why?No. We’re not gonna hire Ryan.Okay.We’ll find him.Really?We have an investor already?Michael, that’s fantastic.Hey! We need to get you dressed!I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That’s one thing I’ve learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let’s go!Next on the list – open the mail.No, okay. It’s fine. It’s fine. We’re just gonna add “find office”…Next on the list —  song parodies.Great. Let’s sing it in the car.Yeah.We can do this.[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!We have a meeting with an investor today.He can be.Hm. I’m looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.Yes. Yes, it’s possible.Michael! What’s going on?Hey, Ryan.This wasn’t on the list.No.It’s not.[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?No.What is he doing?Oh my God.Sorry!Sure.Beat.[mouthing to camera] Nana?It means grandmother.I can’t do this.I can’t do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I – I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?We don’t have any money. We don’t have an office. We don’t have anything.How come out of everyone in the office, I’m the only one that went with you? Is it because I’m that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn’t even believe in you!Yeah.I could work here. I could see this.Are you good?I’m good.",
    "Michael": "Oh, good. My hooker’s here. [laughs] Hi.Yes I was. Yes I was.That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.Thank you. Would you like some french toast?What shape?Alright.After breakfast.So how you feeling about the new company?You excited? About the new company?After breakfast.No, I’m whipping them.Just let go.Let go, please. Just gimmee –I can’t do this! This is pathetic, isn’t it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.I’m not overwhelmed, Pam.Don’t patronize me, Pam.I’m not getting dressed. I’m not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.It’s totally impossible!Assemble a sales team. A dream team.Okay, Ryan.He’s everything I’m not and everything I am. He’s the whole package.Umm… Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I’ve ever met.He worked at that telemarketing place.Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.Yeah.Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.Yeah, I guess it’s not so bad. Got a few things cookin’. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm…Alright.Oh. Wow. “Michael Scott Paper Company.” Okay. Very official. “Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.”How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?Okay. Okay. “Achey Breaky Fart.”No! No No. No. “My Stumps.” Like “My Humps” but a guy with no legs.We can do this.Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you’ll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It’s Michael.Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.I’m…Excuse me. Yes?Yes, it is.Yes.It is.Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?Uh, nine.[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he’s doing.He’s stealing them. Okay, okay.He’s already paying for himself.Right here.Oh yeah.Sounds awesome.People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana’s investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I’m sure that’s what she would have wanted. Does want.Well I’m sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania – Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a – stay standing – from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.By wanting it more. By working hard-Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows:I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.And I offer same day, free delivery.Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don’t – it doesn’t have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other…Well… this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.Okay.Okay.Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don’t have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.What’s that?Blech.Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that’s why God made so many.Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let’s get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay…I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That’s what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or… that’s it. That’s our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don’t believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I’m gonna go inside. I’m going to make some calls, I’m gonna get us an office space, and I’m going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There’s gotta be some sort of secret office that you have… lurkin’ around… some awesome, free, keep it off the books… Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That’s what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don’t think a woman can be a man? Well, then that’s your stereotype, not mine.[walks into room] Okay.It’s right in the middle of the paper belt.Yeah, I’m good. You good?You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where “Dunder Mifflin” is listed right above “Michael Scott Pap”]Yes, I am, Charles.Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol’ can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We’re gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.",
    "Charles": "Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael’s replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.Eh, uh, in a hotel.Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.Okay, let’s go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm…Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear “yes”.Good. As I was saying…You a soccer fan?Well, that makes two of us.Yeah.I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.Yep. Yep. That’s Pele.I know. Yes I do.Oh yeah?I didn’t know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?Well, it’s not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]Yeah?That’s a great idea, Dwight.What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can’t wait!Miner – [kicking a piece of trash]…sees his partner –Halpert. He looks up!Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!Aw, man, I can’t wait to play with you.C’mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?Jim. What do you play?Forward or half?Let’s see what you got in those legs!Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim’s face] No, no, no. That’s supposed to be the kickoff.Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?Why’d you duck, Jim?Does that make you feel better? Huh?Oh, yeah. Jim’s sorry.Michael, you’re back.Mmmhmm.",
    "Kelly": "Where will you be staying while you’re in Scranton?",
    "Phyllis": "I never see him drink. I never see him eat.[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.",
    "Creed": "Oh, he does. He does.",
    "Micheal": "Whatever calms you down.",
    "Vikram": "You got me.Where are we going?He seems really confident.Confidence. It’s the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.He’s taking a long time. Is it possible he’s bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.Hey, c’mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.What sort of investing club is this?I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I’m sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door]",
    "Ryan": "I’m swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.Hey, you.Sixty thousand dollars a year.What do you make, secretary?I told you guys, I’m really busy here, so…What size shoes are you guys?What are those, a men’s ten?Where is it?Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?It was indescribable.Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?",
    "Supervisor": "Back to work, shoe bitch!",
    "Michal": "Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!",
    "Nana": "Michael!So let’s hear it.How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?What’s your mission statement?Michael, I don’t know about this.I’m not so sure.See, this is what concerns me.This isn’t a handout club. It’s an investment club!I love you, Michael. I do.But no. I mean it. No.",
    "Chares": "Okay, striker, huh?",
    "Old Woman": "We could just give him a chance. It’s not much money.",
