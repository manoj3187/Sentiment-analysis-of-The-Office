    "Jim": "[to Pam] Hey.[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what’s this?[reads demerit] “Jim Halpert, tardiness.” Ugh. I love it already.Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?Lay it on me.Now that sounds serious.Which would be me.OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.Oh, you don’t want to know.OK, I’ll call thepolice.[on the phone] OK.[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they’ve already had three calls.Mm… not really, no.[raises hand] Question. Won’t that interfere with your other task forces?Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?Why don’t you run the meeting? You play with dolls.No. Thank you, though.Not really. I’ve seen a bathroom before.I think you mean a girl’sroom. And in the fantasy, there’s usually girls in it.Go crazy.[in women’s bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.Anna Maria’s.Six-month anniversary. What?No, we’ve been dating for six months.Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she’s not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.[snickers at Pam’s sketch] That is pretty cool.Hey, Dwight. It’s Jim.No, you’re not. I’m looking right at you.Don’t. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.I saw him two minutes ago.In the women’s bathroom, above the sink.No. I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t think this is the place to do this.That’s pretty cool.",
    "Dwight": "That is a demerit.You’ve gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.[scoffs] Let’s put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.Three demerits and you’ll receive a citation.Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you’re looking at a violation. Four of those and you’ll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you’re looking at a written warning. Two of those, that’ll land you in a world of hurt… in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.That is correct.What’s a dis… what’s that?[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.Agreed. Let me show you what I’ve been working on.[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael’s desk] There are several penises there I’d love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.Look at that one.Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis – I think you know what I’m referring to – Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know… I know what you’re thinking. [Pam nods] Won’t that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don’t you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?Phyllis, sorry. I’ve got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.Desperate times call for desperate measures.Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?[eating banana] Mm, less than three.You know what? Why doesn’t Oscar run the meeting? He’s a homosexual.Those are collectible action figures and they’re worth more than your car.. Blagh!I wish I could menstruate.If I could menstruate, I wouldn’t have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I’d just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I’d be more in tune with the moon and the tides.Have you finished with the sketch?Hmm, doesn’t seem like the type.Hmm.[Pam’s sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert’s face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.Of course you do, moon face. That’s because you’re a preppy freak, you’re the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.No, duh. That’s why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.More like, “Aye, aye, General.”[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we.Yeah, I do. ‘Cause justice never rests.No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]You know, I may have underestimated you. You’re not a total ass. [coughs][phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.Jim, what are you doing? I’m busy.Ugh. I’m hanging up.You have information about the sex predator?Where?[hangs up and runs to the women’s bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!I got nothing cooking, it’s cooked.  It’s borscht and its served cold.If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.I will never be your vichyssoise.Lets go, fall out, let’s go.  Move, move, move, move, move.",
    "Pam": "[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?What? Really?Oh, my God.[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?[whispering] It’s just, like, so creepy.Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.It’s disgusting and demeaning.Phallus?I don’t often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim’s… Whoo, I am… I am saying a lot of things.That’s OK. I don’t feel like answering phones.[reads memo] “Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.” Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]Yeah.Uh, Phyllis got a good look.[tires screeching] Oh.Oh, yeah. You really shouldn’t litter.What do you want to dish about?OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?Michael, you shouldn’t do anything that you’re uncomfortable with.Oh, my God.Michael, you need to get out of this.No, normal women don’t do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he’s about to start crying]Read the pros first.What was the last one?Michael… you shouldn’t be with someone who doesn’t make you happy.Maybe. But it sounds like you’re just wrong for each other.No one said it has no calories.I’m kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don’t need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.Don’t answer it.Here, uh… Meredith? Why don’t you put your hazards on.I think I’ve got it.I don’t think we really need that, Michael.You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe’s already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!Good luck, Michael.Don’t leave a –It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand…",
    "Phyllis": "I think I just got flashed.In the parking lot.Um… I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out… on the map.I didn’t really get a good look.Michael.When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.Oh, it can be fun.She does have very nice clothes.No, the one before that.I bet you know. Don’t think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?My mom taught me that.Jim’s gonna love it. [Karen giggles]",
    "Andy": "What happened? What can I do to help?I’ll check the web.If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.This guy looks like a real deviant.Aye, aye, Cap’n.Think we’ll find him?[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.Yep. If you don’t mind, I think I’ll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.Hey good lookin’, what ya got cookin’?Hey listen, I’m sure everyone’s already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.Borscht, according to Dwight it’s best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I’m doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight’s trust.I should make you my vichyssoise.Let me be clear.  There’s only one thing that’s important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don’t know.  I don’t have to know.  That’s what makes me so dangerous.",
    "Angela": "Phyllis. You’re a married woman.What is so funny?What a surprise.And when we get mad, you always ask us if we’re on our periods.This is not work talk.Malls are just awful and humiliating. They’re just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior’s section. There are petite adults who are sort of… smaller who need to wear… maybe a kids’ size 10.Meredith, slow down! We’re not gonna get there any faster if we’re dead.Thank you, Michael.OK. I’m gonna be at the doll store.Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I’m forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael’s cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.",
    "Creed": "The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what’s all the fuss?If that’s flashing, then lock me up.Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?What are you doing in here? This is the women’s room.I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall][wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I’m a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women’s room for number two. I’ve been caught several times and I have paid dearly.",
    "Ryan": "[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]What’s the occasion?Nothing – I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um –I figured. It’s cool. I don’t – I wouldn’t want to be in an office relationship anyway.",
    "Michael": "What’s happening?Really? Is she OK?OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]Um… I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh… Karen from behind?[laughing softly] I’m sorry. It’s pretty funny when you think about it.Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant’s zipper] He’s back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It’s, uh… [laughs]Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she’s not even here, so no harm, no foul.Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you’re the flasher.Uh-huh. Prove it. Let’s see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I… you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can’t have fun if they don’t feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time… she pretended she didn’t hear me.Huh?I don’t know. I feel… I drive a lot. I’m spending a fortune on gas and tolls –Um, that… I don’t know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.I… uh, well, I don’t know.[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can’t happen. Not in my house.OK.This is the lastthat Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.Dwight, are those your pants? That’s a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don’t you just take these women, put ’em in a burlap sack, and hit ’em with a stick? Because that’s what you’re doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.See? That’s what we’re talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That’s it. Conference room, five minutes. Women’s appreciation.Oh, I don’t know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?That is not current.You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.I, um… would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.OK, no catfights. Please. Let’s – my point is… my point is… a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.What are…? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women’s problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren’t really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn’t care. Society sucks. I don’t even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.No. I’m being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.Yes.Because wha… that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.I have to know whether you’re serious or not.Ye – OK, yes.You’re right. You’re right, you’re right. And you know why? It’s because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we’re gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]OK, let’s go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let’s go![Meredith parking the car] I don’t think she’s gonna make it. Don’t think she’s gonna make it – [metal scraping]Many womencompetent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on.All right. Hope nobody’s on a diet.You’re welcome. You’re welcome, you’re welcome. OK. So, let’s dish.Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it “shmear?” Like the cream cheese.What, um… what do you think of role-play?Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.I just… I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.Jan says anything that doesn’t scare us is not worth doing. I don’t know. Maybe we’re different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.No, it’s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.No, she’s… she’s fooling around. It’s a woman thing.No… No, it’s all right. I’m OK. I’m OK. [sniffing] You guys… what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts:not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I’m unhappy when I’m with her. Flat-chested.She’s totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.I’m unhappy when I’m with her.I’m happy sometimes. Um… when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.Yeah, that’s smart.That sounds good too. I don’t know who’s right. I just don’t – I don’t know. I don’t know.I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria’s Secret] Come on. Get in here.Let’s face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They’re caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But… for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.Mm. You don’t want anything? My treat. Some panties or… pick a thong or… G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any – it just – you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It’s Jan. What do I do?OK, it stopped.Uh, yeah. Yep. Um… Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will…Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let’s see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the… all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]Do you have a… a crescent? A crescent Allan?Uh… you know what? I’m going to… you take care of that. I’m gonna do traffic… detail.OK, I am really going to do this.You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let’s do this. Let’s do it. [sighs]I love you guys.  Now I’m getting her voicemail.[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I’ll talk to you later.Thank you.Abso-fruit-ly.No… No…Yeah.Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] “… to remain friends. Or at least business associates -” [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] “who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. OK, buddy.”[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There’s a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. “Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?” You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.Love it.Uh, yes, I am.Uh, yeah, it’s okay. Its just, I don’t think the cartoons are very funny.The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don’t, I don’t know. I guess I get it.We should really start recycling.Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it’s uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.I got shotgun.  Damn it.Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.Idiot.I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn’t like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can’t believe I’m gonna say this, maybe, women don’t understand themselves.",
    "Kevin": "I’m guessing not.Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women’s bathroom?You aren’t curious?Yeah, but… it’s every guy’s fantasy.[quietly] Yeah. I’m going in.[in women’s bathroom] Oh… my… God.Yes.[in women’s bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.You’re in here.[all get up to leave] OK.",
    "Toby": "Hey, what’s going on? There’s a police car in the…What’s going on?I don’t think laughing about it is an appropriate response.I don’t think the women in this office –I was at a parent-teacher conference.Hey, uh… where’d you decide to take Karen tonight?I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.",
    "Jan": "[on speakerphone] Michael, ……come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.I’ll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I’ll leave it on the dresser.$300?You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you’re coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?Michael… [clears throat] I was, um… I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I… I just – I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So… [takes Michael’s hand] I’m sorry.So… we’re good?[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I’m sorry.One second. Oh! It’s from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?OK. [voice on phone] “It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want…”Oh. [door closes]So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?Good, good, it’s the best business reporting isn’t it?Wait, wait, what cartoons?[Sigh]Right uh, Michael.",
    "Hunter": "[on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.",
    "Karen": "Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] “Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.” This is ridiculous.Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.Look, it’s really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.What you’re saying is extremely misogynistic.I’m saying that you’re being sexist.That – it’s the same thing.Can we just get back to work?Frankly, it’s kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So… I could do that.It’s a pretty common one.That is not healthy behavior.OK, OK. Um, cons.Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?Answer it.OK, remember, be strong.",
    "Meredith": "I don’t remember doing that.Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]My car, my rules.It’s a little too tight. I’m gonna find another spot.[tires screeching] Crap.",
    "Kelly": "Thanks, Michael.Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.[bang] Whoa.Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?Hey, what’s going on?[Screams][sings] We’re going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.",
    "Stanley": "Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.Okay, you need to stop that right now.",
    "Bob": "Phyllis, you okay? You sure?"
