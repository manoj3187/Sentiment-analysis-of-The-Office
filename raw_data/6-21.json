    "Michael": "Buenos dias, Erin.No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for… for all of North America. And… I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.Buenos dias, Jaime.Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!La telefona.[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.Yo soy Cancun.Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.Did somebody order a hooker over here?Hi. How are you?There’s this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter’s and, right now, we’re in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so…Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.[barges in] Hi.Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria’s Secret?Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.Okay, I have more of them.I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you… there we go! [Michael’s picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.It’s subtle. That’s how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. \tAnd then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn’t know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she’s turned on.This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I’ve never taken anybody there before.Ryan.And that’s it. That’s me. That’s who I am.Oh, thanks. [softly] You’re not bad, either.Hmm.Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?[in his office] You didn’t see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?Maybe wee find some wiggle room?I think we could. [Donna giggles]Okay, well sometimes… sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.Why don’t you run them again?If she is, it’s working.So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller…Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?They’re good [Donna grabs mint]Sure.I can’t stop myself from kissing her.Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it’s not totally insane to try one more time.Okay. What do you think?Andy?Okay, some for, some against.Pam?I’m going with Pam’s group.Here we go.Okay.No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just… thank you for talking. Wish me luck.What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that’s not… the point.We should have your contract done by Thursday.Okay.Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.I don’t know. I think so.[whispers] Okay. So… Oh, Donna?Thank you so much.Mmm. [Donna giggles][follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um… okay, if you have… if there’s any other questions that you have…All right. All right. Bye.And have a good elevator ride.Oh, what’s that out there?I don’t know. I don’t know. Can’t really trust my feelings anymore.She suckered you too.Was it the cleavage?Yep.God. She left this here?Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.Yeah. This could be a signal. People don’t just take barrettes off.[hold up barrette] Well…Yeah, I know. I know.I know. You’re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office][runs down to parking lot, sighs]Oh. You’re still here. I have your baguette.You know what? Everybody told me that you weren’t interested. Everybody. And I didn’t believe ’em. And they were right. So… there’s your barrette.Who?About what?No, no. No.No… [they kiss again][returns to office] What happened?Really?! Oh, that’s great. That’s such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.No, I’m serious. It… this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was… I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki… We did. Okay. We did. We did.You know what? It doesn’t matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!",
    "Erin": "Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.Holy cow. I’d be so happy.I know. I meant I’d be happy for them.Mm!Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?Yeah.Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?Great.Kelly got into the minority training program.",
    "Jim": "Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?All right, so I’ll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.Yeah, or maybe we don’t even need that.[whispers] That’s a good point.Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.[whispering] I don’t even know who you are anymore.Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I’m Jim.How are you?All right.[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it’s a tradeoff.Hold on one second.What?None of this is time sensitive.No.Well, maybe you shouldn’t try to kiss people at work.Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.What?What was that?Pam, you know he’s not gonna get anywhere, and he’s gonna blow our sale.Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of flexibility.Yeah. [chuckles]What’s that?I don’t… I don’t think so.What if she’s just flirting with you to get a better price?She does not like him.’cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.Well, the joke was on you.It is totally insane.Nobody’s for.Okay.What?Wait.Michael. Michael.Michael.No.What?",
    "Dwight": "Guten tag, Herr Michael.I don’t understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?What is this?It doesn’t just sound a’ight, it sounds amazing.How do I apply?Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?Come here. Come here.Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he’s Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm… the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?Oh, man. White people, right?Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.I know, ’cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO’s can you think of?You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.That’s not… she’s… okay. Yes.How as being a minority affected you?Oh, good, and you resent this because…Oh, no, no. That’s not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it’s easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler’s in the house. Inside the house.Hey… what are you guys doing?You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.Ryan? What does he know?“We?”Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you’d have told me this morning that today I’d be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I ‘d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.Kelly is disqualified!You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well… anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You’re welcome, America.Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.Kelly is the only applicant.Oh, dear God. Okay. Don’t make any decisions just yet. Okay? I’ll be right back.How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?I wasn’t talking to you, pale-face.What I’m offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.Yes.Speaking of rainbows, Oscar… you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program “print in all colors” initiative.Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I’ll translate.You don’t know what you need. Just…Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]Oh.Gosh. He he.Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",
    "Oscar": "El telefono.Michael’s having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um… [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.Your office is full of genitalia.“That’s what he says?”I don’t see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost…Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.Michael, he’s right. You are turning into a stalker.Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We’re not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.It’s not a signal. It’s just a coincidence. No, it’s not even a coincidence. It’s just something that happened.",
    "Angela": "Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela’s forehead with female genitalia] Michael.[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!I knew it. You should see their baby.",
    "Pam": "You know, maybe there’s an opportunity for a joke there, like, um… like, [vaudeville delivery] “I just delivered a baby. They didn’t offer me a guarantee.”This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we’re gonna work really well together.We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.[vaudeville delivery] Yee.Oh, no we’re actually married. We’re not brother and sister.I’ll have one.Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn’t still be here.What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It’s not that huge a sale.Don’t act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat’s Jim’s arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]Maybe she’s just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?I was after your money.Yes, it was.Hmm?Um… I think it’s really, really unlikely.Really unlikely. But I can’t say that it’s impossible.I’m not saying she’s in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?You know what, Michael? For what it’s worth… I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.Mm-hmm.Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.Michael…She doesn’t want you to return the barrette. She’s not interested in you.I’m sorry.Michael! [sighs]",
    "Donna": "Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.Hi![laughing] Oh, stop that.You look exactly alike.I have a sense about these things.You have some ancestors in common… somewhere back.Oh, yeah, thank you.Mm-hmm.Yeah.Who took the photo?Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is “SEX” in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly][giggles] Not bad.Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20’s it would have been annoying. In my late 20’s, I find it really flattering.Is this… is this the best you can do right there?Oh. Well, I guess I’m just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you’re in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.Mm-hmm.Yes.Oh, I haven’t tried those. No.You want one?It’s like cool… “certified cool.” I like how they say “certified.” Like there’s some consortium of… [Michael grabs the mint from Donna’s hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.And, um… you know I just wanted to say it was really… really nice to do business with you.Thank you. Did I… get everything?Yeah, I think so.Yeah? Do you need validation? We don’t… we don’t validate.No, it’s just in the lot, so…You’re welcome. [they hug] You’re… welcome.Bye.I don’t have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I’m just gonna… make my way down to…Bye-bye!Okay.[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!No, y-you were… right.You were right.You were right. [Michael leans into Donna’s car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I’m sorry.I’m sor…",
    "Gabe": "You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.Oh, this is “Print in All Colors,” Sabre’s minority executive training program.You have to be a minority.Those don’t really count. We’re thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.Hmm?Well…What?Yeah, but she’s not white, though.Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He’s gone.Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.That’s very nice. [referring to Kelly’s bindi] I never noticed that before.Yeah. I don’t want to be offensive but, uh… may I ask you what that means?Well, uh… why don’t you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.They’re going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She’ll be the first. The program’s mostly black. It’s almost too black. That didn’t sound right.",
    "Darryl": "Sounds all right.I didn’t say “a’ight.”I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I’ll be sitting in Michael’s chair. Wouldn’t that be something?I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.",
    "Kelly": "[on phone] This is the second time that you’ve sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I’ve been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.I don’t know if she was white.Yeah.Well, they say it’s because of texting, but maybe you’re right.Never thought of myself as an executive before.I can’t think of any CEO’s, any race.I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.Well, there’s a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It’s so dorky.Just put it in your pocket.[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I’m trying to make her anorexic.Oh, that is so good.Oh, that’s okay. Ryan coached me.Would you ask that same question if I was white? We’re so in.When I become executive, I’m gonna make Ryan manager.Namaste.Hello.Sometimes my bangs cover it.I do find that offensive, actually.For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.Dwight:What are you doing?God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves][puts a bindi on Erin’s forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I’m not gonna need anymore.Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.Thank you, Dwight.I’ll never forget everything that you’ve done for me.Because I never forget anything.",
    "Michael and Donna": "[indistinct chatter inside conference room]",
    "Kevin": "[looking it] Look at that. She’s totally flirting with him.[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]Yeah, Michael, here’s a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says “no,” then she is not interested.Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M’s all day.Well, why don’t you shut up!I think it’s over, man.Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]Ooh.",
    "Phyllis": "You don’t know that. Some people can’t help oozing sexuality.She just crossed her arms together… that’s bad.Michael, you know, it’s easy to get fooled. Bob’s warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It… it’s mostly harmless. Usually I don’t let it go too far.Oh, Michael.",
    "Creed": "You ever notice you can ooze two things:sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.",
    "Ryan": "Okay…Tell her everyone in home room thinks she’s fat.It’s easy… you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you’re treated differently because of your race?And then the two of us are cleanin’ house.",
    "Andy": "Well, why don’t you just move the M&M’s?Ehh.You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh… I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she’s touching around down there. It’s easy to get confused.",
    "Mihael": "What do you think?",
    "Stanley": "Dwight, I know these programs. “Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.”I’ll slap you in the face with a rainbow.",
    "Hide": "Why? I don’t need translator.In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.",
    "All": "No."
