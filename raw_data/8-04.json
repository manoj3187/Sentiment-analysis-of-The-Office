    "Jim": "[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.You’ve seen it, right?There’s this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there’s an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a… phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it’ll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.Okay, don’t be gross.Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?[pointing to computer monitor] So, we’ve typed in the address, now let’s take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?I’m actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I’ve only sold one copy.Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.Oh, hey, how are you doing, I’m Jim.No.No, no, no, no, no. No.Chapter 4 â€“ One of the host’s most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.Chapter 9 â€“ The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.Closing ceremonies.I think I left my wallet in your house.Right here.Keys, keys…I didn’t forget them, they’re right here.I’m so sorry, I think I forgot that thing…Whoo.Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.",
    "Andy": "Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?How’d it look?No.What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.Which one did you see?Yeah, Dwight.Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.It’s just a garden party. Sheesh.You don’t need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It’s a garden party. You don’t need a reason.Few other super simple reminders â€“ no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?I get it, I’m being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all… step it up.This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it’s a garden party.Aw, ew, please don’t. Not a barbecue. It’s better than a barbecue. It’s dignified, quieter, there are rules.I’m glad you asked â€“ Connecticut Casual.Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother’s promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there’s a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.It’s my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn’t really support another harmony part, so… Check it out, that’s my brother’s boss. Look how psyched he is, he’s having an awesome time.Yeah, of course. Ye… I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.Ooh, that sounds great.Sure.Uh, I’ll hear the other one.You know, the marmalade sounds great.Then the basil will be fine.How’s it going over here, guys?Didn’t mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you’re able, keep your elbows off the table.Well, technically FOR Andy.I don’t know how you got there.This branch, I’m the regional manager.Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That’s crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn’t care less.Can I introduce you around now?What are you going to see?What??I didn’t know you were going to be here.Welcome.Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.So pretty today.Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn’t make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That’s my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.Let’s hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?You can’t triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.Yeah, yeah.Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!Ah, come on!Yes!Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar][singing] Saying I love you is not the words…Yeah?Right, it feels strange.Saying I love… Saying I love you…Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin![applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I’d very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn’t even my worst sales call.I don’t know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you’d be proud of me.I know, I know that you’re proud of me.Hey everybody, I’m gonna leave and I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.Um, cheeseburger.Thanks, Oscar.Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?Awesome.Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d’oeuvres and the animals on Noah’s ark?With Hors d’oeuvres we only take one at a time.My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it’s just that maybe one’s a little higher than the other?",
    "Pam": "Andy, somebody defaced it.Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.How is that better than a barbecue?Nope.Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don’t, don’t say anything, okay? It’s after my grandfather.[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It’s after my grandfather.I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!What are they doing?Nice touch.Yeah, she just went down.Aww.Yes, after my grandfather.Well I’m having my baby first, so that’s that.You think your doctor’s going to give you a C-section at six months?",
    "Erin": "Six months.Ahh! [bird steals her hat]I think we should toast…[holding up cell phone] It’s either taping or calling.Sorry.",
    "Meredith": "[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.Yeah, whoa, who’s the sausage?Hell no. She wishes.Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you’ll never be able to sing again. Woo!Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I’m a lady. I’m a mother. I’m a former boxer!",
    "Dwight": "[entering office] What’s going on?Oh, that’s funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it’s right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you’ve probably gone too far.It’s simpler this way.And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.They don’t warn you when the cameras are driving by.There’s so much more to it than that.I’ve been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I’ve got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]MR. RYAN HOWARD!STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.My first love is beet farming, but it’s a young man’s game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it’s still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?I can get you exotic meats â€“ hippo steaks, giraffe burgers…It’ll all be goat.Who cares.MR. JAMES HALPERT!Stop forgetting things.MR. JAMES HALPERT!What? Idiot.MIS… MI… What are you doing?That’s a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!Erin….the receptionist!When all this is over, I’d like to actually go to one of Trickington’s parties, they sound like a blast.Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you…the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]",
    "Ryan": "Just give us the address. We’ll look it up online.What’s the dress code on this?This is not funny, man, let me down.It’s not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.I’d like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.That’s because you didn’t bring a jacket.Yeah! I’m too hot anyway.Can’t wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment’s at 9%. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.",
    "Oscar": "It’s really not.Andy, we understand basic table manners, we’re not children.Andy, stop hovering, you’re being really annoying.Wow.Technically FOR Robert California. He’s our CEO.Guess we found Andy’s rosebud.It’s a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.Different school of thought. Let’s just agree to disagree.Narddog. [throws Andy a can]I cannot believe how condescending Andy’s being.",
    "Kelly": "I don’t get the reason for this party.What’s the reason, Andy? What’s the reason?I am so cold.",
    "Phyllis": "Yeah, what’s the reason?Yeah, it’s just a picnic.Why didn’t you just say this was to impress Robert California?",
    "Darryl": "What happens when we’re done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?There’s a grill in the warehouse I could bring.I’ve seen this, that’s not you.Yeah, I’ll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]I think if I had parents like that I’d be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.Rosebud?I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn’t explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.No. You’re wrong.Cheeseburger or hamburger.He gets condescending when he’s nervous. Or when he’s excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.",
    "Stanley": "Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I’m wearing to your party.",
    "Kevin": "Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.[mouthful of food] I understand.I think this thing is broken.Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.What?Oh, OK. What’s the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?",
    "Gabe": "I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don’t steal my business strategies, and I won’t dress like my life is just one long brunch?I can’t believe I didn’t think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley’s mistress?I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,…To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you…",
    "Angela": "Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?I’ve already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?Phillip?Phillip is the name that we’re using. It’s after my favorite cat.It’s after my cat.I would like to toast someone who isn’t here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!She just always has to copy anything I do! It’s the Ford Taurus situation all over again!Little Cici asleep?Such a precious little angel.Cecilia….and Phillip.Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn’t even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It’s just something you do to a hole!You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I’ll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.",
    "Robert": "[on the phone] Andrew, I’ve picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.You don’t want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.It’s a basil plant.I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she’s very interested.Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]Hello Andy.Thank you.Yes, hello, nice to meet you.Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?No, I’m certain you said basil.I’ll say a few words if that’s alright with you, Andy.You people say I led you, but it wasn’t me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us.  I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?We’ll talk. [walks away]Are you sure?My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn’t that strange? I’ve never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that’s nice. Thank you.",
    "Toby": "Hey, where do I park?Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.It’s probably okay…I think it’s better that I…It’s a finicky car…It’s a little tricky, you might have to… take… [Mose speeds away]",
    "Mose": "I’m the valet. You have to give me your car.I’m the… I’m the valet. You have to give me your car.Give me your car.Give me your car.Get out. Have a good time at the thing.",
    "Walter": "So, you all work with Andy.You said you were running the company.Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?Uh, yeah, we don’t have too long, we have theater tickets.Money Ball. Walter Jr.’s choice.Pleasure.We really should be leaving.I’m eating, Andy.Okay. Okay.What do you want to do?Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It’s a little tricky.It’s too high.It’s high but it’s not that high.Just take it down a little.Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like… [singing] Saying I love you is…You don’t come in yet. [singing] …I want to hear from you, It’s not that I want you…You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don’t you come up and join us?[knocks] Hi. What was that display?Andrew…I’m not going to tell you how impressed I am that you’re a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You’re a grown man, don’t act like a little boy who needs…It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food…",
    "Ellen": "I thought you were the CEO.It’s getting chilly.Sandwiches were dry.",
    "Walter Jr": "Hey Bronard!I wouldn’t have missed it.I’m Walter, Andy’s younger brother.Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith].Dad, no. I’m just having a good time getting to know Andy’s friends here.Bye Tuna, bye Pam!",
    "Waiter": "Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests.",
    "Andy & Walter": "…not the words……not to say it but if you only knew… More than words is all you have to do to make it real…What would you do if my heart was torn in two…",
    "Walter & Walter Jr": "[singing] May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you’re far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you’d have done to you…",
    "Erin’s Cell Phone": "If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
