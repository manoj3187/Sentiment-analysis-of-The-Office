    "Dwight": "Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?No, I said one of them is not a nickel.Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, …A man is found hanging from the ceiling…A hunter.Damn it!So you excited?Very excited?Extremely excited? … Just very?  That’s cool.I am very excited. Ryan hasn’t made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn’t made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.Do you know where we are, temp?I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When… Damn it.And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I’m going to plant my seed in you.Smells pretty bad, doesn’t it?It’s called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I’ll be right back.Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.You know what your problem is? You know why you haven’t made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?Come on!Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.Yes.Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won’t hang out with Mose so much anymore.What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin’s suicide?Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott’s greatest fear?Wrong. He’s not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it’s all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.Wrestle him to the ground.Ryan. Don’t. Ryan! You don’t have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?Where are all the animals?Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.You still mad? It’s just Jim and I didn’t get along, and I didn’t want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.Screwgun. The sales call!Establish time frames. Keep the phrase “real dollars” in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That’s why you’re losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.Good.Right.Uh huh.Exactly. Yes.They did not. They didn’t have to say it to your face.Not everything’s a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It’s those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They’re going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.Take a good look at this boy……because you are never going to see him again.Today is Ryan’s first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.I once saw a movie called “Training Day”. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.Get in the car.Don’t you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan’s ear]No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get… get in the car.Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It’s also in here.[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan’s ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study:me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It’s a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the… Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You’re lucky I don’t have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.",
    "Ryan": "A dime and a nickel.But the other one is. I’ve heard that before.Because he’s my son. The doctor is the boy’s mother.He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.It’s a polar bear because you’re at the North Pole.Yeah.Yes. I’m very excited.I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight’s the top salesman in the company and he’s taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I’m excited.So what if they’re not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just ’till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where’s the sales office?I know where we’re not.I don’t think you know what you’re saying.Uh huh.Gotcha.Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.Hey Dwight, you’re a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I’ll make you the ole commodor.  I’ll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I’ll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you’re doing. I get it.Yeah.Who was that?Is that your Cousin Mose?Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.Depression?Um, loneliness. Maybe women.No. Ok. All right. All right. It’s over. This is over.  OK.No, you’re a freak. I’m not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.Look, that, that’s not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.Wait, can you go back?Ok, I’m going to establish time frames.I’m going to put everything in terms of “real dollars”.I’m going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.I’m going to try to be confident, but not cocky.They really didn’t like me.I don’t get it. I don’t get what I did wrong.You drive.I think about that all the time.Yeah. Yeah.I don’t have a key.He’s the top salesman at the company. He’s the top salesman at the company. He’s the top salesman at the company. Today’s gonna be great.Huh.What was that first thing you did?Oh.It’s going okay. I’ve already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I’d know.You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I’m gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I… there’s a step missing. “Hey, mom.” “Hey, Ryan. How’s that five-year plan coming?” “Oh, it’s great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.” “Oh, that’s cool.” “Yeah, that’s really cool. I’m learning a lot. I’m really glad I took this full-time job.”",
    "Jan": "Tell me what you did yesterday.Nothing?I don’t care how your day was Michael.Tell me what you did yesterday.Hi, Pam.I’m great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?Thanks Pam.What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.Zoning out?If you can account for your time……then maybe corporate can justify your salary.",
    "Michael": "Uhhh… nothing.Yeah, nothing. How was your day?Wow. Well. Ok. I don’t care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I’m just going to have my soft pretzel, then I’ll get to work, and I’ll be super productive. Look out for me.[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh… Come on.Uh huh.[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?No, I think you’re cutting in line.No, I’m not going to settle down.Get in the back please.Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five’s Stanley]. That’s right.No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I’d like to see. You read my mind.I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You’re an angel.Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I’ll be back.Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.Thank God.Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?All right! Thank you!Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What’s going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let’s make a deal. So what is the deal?Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second…Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.And I will be taking questions.Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I’m going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we’re getting a lot done, don’t you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!Hey, what time is it?AM or PM?Oh, good.Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.Yes. Right. Good.Goodnight!Well, that’s really not the way I roll, because sometimes I’m in the zone, and sometimes I’m in the zoning out.Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I’ll do it.Yes, big if.A woman spurned.I always do.If you lay a finger…Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.“9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE:log. Lost log. Found log.” “10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.” That’s on the wrong page.Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that’s in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today’s a good day to do that.What makes them so good?I mean, they’re just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.",
    "Pam": "Hi.Oh, I don’t know if I’m…It’s weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it’s like he’s five.Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It’s really not a big deal. To some people it is.Michael.Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.Hey, why don’t you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I’ll just bring you a pretzel.You know, I just think it’s really important that you be productive today.Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He’s, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.Night.20 past 5.PM.These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?This is a huge sale.Night, Michael.[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.Oh my God.Hi.Oh.I had to work late. Jan’s making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.Yeah, totally. So…Do you…Uh, no, I um. Everything’s pretty much the same here.A little different. What time is it there?Oh, yeah. Right.I don’t know. It felt far.What?I type 90.It’s true.70? How many do you type?Come on. Tell me.You have to tell me now.No, it’s, that’s respectable.So ok. I’m watching the movie, by myself…Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home…And, I’m freaking out.That movie is so scary!But I’m holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don’t put the pictures on the box.Would I make that up?Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.I have one kitchen.It’s actually…Three kitchens?[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?Um. Ok, bye.No, I was um…You have to go?No, I should probably go too.I mean, yeah.Bye Jim.It’s like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan’s body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It’s an old bet, but a deal’s a deal.Hey, let’s focus today. Make today all about focus. I’ll help you.Yeah.",
    "Karen": "[squeaky chair] Hey.My chair is squeaking.You took my chair.When you get up, I’m just going to take it back anyway, so…That’s it? That’s what you came up with?Really?[rocks in squeaky chair]stop.This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.This is not a proportionate response.Look, I’ve never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.But if you said “Go ahead, make my day,” I would know that it’s from “Dirty Harry”. How can you not know that’s from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”?You didn’t know that “Bueller?” was from Ferris Bueller?",
    "Jim": "What?Is it?No, I didn’t. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn’t take your chair.So I guess I can’t get up.Sure.[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,Go on and fool me.

It’s a fantasy football thing.And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn’t think you’d be there. Why, why are you still there?Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?So…Oh, I’m sorry. Go ahead.Oh, good.What time is it here? Um, we’re in the same time zone.How far away did you think we were?Yeah. I have a question for you.How many words per minute does the average person type?Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn’t even type 90.Ok, I said average.Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.No.65. Ok, no need to laugh.Respectable?Right.Ok.Yeah.I know!No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?No, you’re making this up!Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.And how many kitchens?Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.Most apartments these days have like three.Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?Pam?Pam?Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.Oh, no no.Yeah, uh, well.Ok.Yeah.

You asked for my help, so I helped.I don’t care ’bout anything but you… what ever happened to those guys?Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.Seriously, you guys, ask me.Let’s just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would’ve broken a few laws.",
    "Announcer": "Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o’clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.",
    "Stanley": "I wake up every morning in a bed that’s too small, drive my daughter to a school that’s too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.No way.Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.This is Pretzel Day.Thank you! [takes pretzel]Three hundred and sixty four days, ’till the next Pretzel Day.There’s four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.I do not know.That’s what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh]",
    "Kelly": "Because they acted all tough and everything…But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to…I can’t believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?Oh my God, I’m so worried.I don’t know. Dwight’s so weird.No, he’s a freak.",
    "Phyllis": "I’m just saying hi to Bob.What’s on your suit?",
    "Bob": "Well settle down, Scott.What a pair of Mary’s.",
    "Pretzel guy": "We do.And we have 18 different toppings.
