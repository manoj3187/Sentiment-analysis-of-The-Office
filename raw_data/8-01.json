    "Oscar": "Oh, for God’s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That’s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.Good night Andy.I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]I know.I’ll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.",
    "Erin": "Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don’t.  And I don’t.  But I am so excited to be a part of it.Here we go.Robert California. Let’s have a conversation.Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I’ve been doing this thing-Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert’s notebook]No.Andy, don’t go in there!I like my new group. I liked my old group.",
    "Andy": "[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.I insist.[drumroll with hands] I… it’s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice’s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, “I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.” Smart, right?Uh, this has got to stop.Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don’t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women’s soccer, no?Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.Oh, okay. I don’t want any part of this.I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side’s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.We couldn’t crack it.He’ll know that we looked at his private notebook.I’m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it’s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.What’s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.And it was open. And people saw this. And they’re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.It’s a photocopy from your notebook.No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.What?That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?Okay. Robert’s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.Dwight!Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!Great group! Pizza party!Well, why don’t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.C’mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?Yeah?When I was a salesman I could just be like “Not my job, not my prob. I’m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.” Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it’s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let’s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.Thank you. Great.  Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you’re talking about?Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I’m thinking of. Can you clarify that?No. No, no.I’m going in there.I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don’t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I’m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley… you may think he’s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he’s hard to love, but did you know that he’s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?Meredith Palmer… Supplier relations. The word “no” not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I’m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we’re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.Yes, I do.I don’t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits]Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.Well, you got it this year too.Night.Night.I gotta say, I think it’s kinda cool not knowing. It’s like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It’s kinda sophisticated.Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There’s no way to know if you’re dead!",
    "Dwight": "No, I insist.K… Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight’s desk]Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I’ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I’ve added boxing – lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I’m doin’ great.K, I’m gonna need some help. Pam?Hoist him aloft. C’mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]Say no more.[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don’t try planking. It’s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ‘Specially with me around.What are you looking at?It can’t be nothing.[throws hard, Jim doesn’t catch] Nice catch.Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?… 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]Okay, which side of the list am I on?Yes!This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here’s something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive’ situation. No… that can’t be it.Shhh, Pam. C’mon, don’t be such a right-sider.No, it’s not. Here’s how we find out. Let’s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let’s just size each other up here and left side of the list… ATTACK!That’s great. Let’s do this guys.You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question… what made you pick this group?Okay!Losers.C’mon.C’mon, c’mon.C’mon.Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it’s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.Good night.[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it’s like hoisting a manatee. I can’t get a grip it’s so vast.God. How do whalers do it?Steak. Rare.One more. To our boss!You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?Oh, tips are expected?Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl….Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!Winners!",
    "Jim": "The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California… for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO… CEO… her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don’t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   And he chose…Oh, yeah. Pregnant.No, I told you I don’t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.No one should be planking at all.You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it’s just gonna make you cry?He’s got a bank vault. That’s a start.The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he’s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it’s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It’s strange.[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?It’s, it’s nothing.It’s just a list of our names, split into two columns.Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?No. Okay. Um, I’ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?We don’t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-I promise you, we don’t need a warning-Left.Why are you- How do you know?Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert’s notebook.Okay, it’s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.I don’t think it’s-That’s not it.Mmum, still wrong.Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.Hey. It’s nothing. Alright? I’ll text you when we get there. Let you know what’s going on.Nope. No dog video.Okay. See you guys.Uhhh, the street?Oh, I didn’t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.Right.Yeah, she does like Elmo.Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?Shhh.Alright, I’m gonna go warm up the car.Ryan? A little help?Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.Good. What? Nothin’I don’t think we have to do this again cause it’s gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]Come on, man.",
    "Kelly": "(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.I can’t get down.How is this a pizza party?Yeah, well, that’s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?Everybody hates those endings!",
    "Pam": "I don’t think I should.Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.Wait, when did we start calling it that-Well, I am a few months ahead of you.Because everything makes me cry, so what’s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.Not enough though.Jim. [motions him over]If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]He left it at reception and we photocopied it.Maybe it’s a list of people he’s gonna fire.‘Scuse me?I love you so much. [starting to cry]Okay. [turns to computer]Okay.That’s regular pizza.[Pam’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. “This is getting very weird. Will explain later.”[Everyone’s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, “Who’s that receptionist? I like her.” Now I’m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you’re like, “Oh, loser.”Oh. Oh God.Yeah, I’m fine.Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?Okay, I know I’ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, “Pam” and “Cece” on one side, “Everything else” on the other] I mean, that’s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it’s stupid. No. [starts crying] It’s wonderful. I’m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.Oh! Text from Jim. “This is…” hmm.",
    "Angela": "Look, it’s a ‘Little Pregs’ [points to her belly] and ‘Big Pregs’ [points to Pam’s]Isn’t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim… the great salesman.Did you guys figure it out?It was excellent.Bye.Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.",
    "Darryl": "I’m lifting.Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin’ much better. This soda. This is mine.Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.Good times.Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.",
    "Stanley": "It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I’m telling someone how to do somethin’. I go on with a long description and then I say, “and shove it up your butt.” It’s stupid, but it’s my thing now.What?Go in there and just ask the man what it means.Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!What’s that?That’s pizza.We get that every year.",
    "Robert": "Hello.Describe your day so far.And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It’s a waste of your time. That’s how every day’s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.What are your thoughts.[Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god’s sake Andy. Yes, come in.Great. Thank you.What is this?You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.Ah, please. Here’s what it is. It’s a doodle.Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don’t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I’m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.Might as well have been sketching a cube.[enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I’d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?Sesame street.Elmo, god’s sake, it’s the Elmo era.Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn’t you agree.I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.No.I don’t- I don’t wanna say-No, no.Ha, I guess I think they’re losers.Probably shouldn’t have said that. [Jim’s jaw drops]I never said that.Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I’ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you’re a winner. If I didn’t, I don’t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.I’m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don’t use ballpoint pens.I did not know about the sales figures.Are we done?You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.That sounds good.Jim, you alright? What are you doing?I can expense it.Thank you.",
    "Phyllis": "Yeah, it can’t be nothing.Ahhh! [falls out of chair]Yeah. Yeah. Oh.Thanks guys.C’mon, just say you saw the list by accident.Yeah, that’s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?Completely.Well, what about the other guys.Whew, well. I guess that’s that.Good night, Andy.I’ll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.",
    "Kevin": "We need a warning signal.We do.WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!I know! It’s alphabetical.Warning! Warning! Warning!The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up “L” to his forehead]I was looking for patterns.Chicken piccata, side salad.",
    "Meredith": "Maybe we’re s’posed to do it with people in our group.People in the other group.Hey!“Suck it losers.”[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It’ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.Hey, this ain’t no Breakfast Club, bitch.",
    "Everyone": "[separately] No.[separately] Awww.",
    "Toby": "I should not be here. I’m in the- I was in the wrong- I’m- I’m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.Guys. Really, it’s ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don’t think there’s any reason for anybody to worry.I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.Chicken piccata, side salad.",
    "Ryan": "Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn’t the fact that I’m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!It’s all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He’s a genius. You guys just don’t get him.Here’s the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.It’s called owling. You’ll read about it in like eight months.Profound man, your husband.",
    "Creed": "I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50’s, they’re meaningless.",
    "Gabe": "Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly]Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I’m here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I’m in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn’t get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you’ll be part of them. You’ll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.",
    "All": "Hey!",
    "Darryl & Oscar": "Let him expense it, Dwight.",
    "Waiter": "Hi, Mr. Shrute. I’ve waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.Yes sir."
