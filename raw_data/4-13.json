    "Michael": "Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!Yeah, I’m pretty excited too.Today I’m heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.Yup.Why are you dressed like that?Like you’re applying for a loan.Okay, here’s what we’re going to do:I’m going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No… uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don’t have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain’t going to college.Let’s go![Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don’t you think?This is all we need.Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello!Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, “only the best and the brightest.”He’s totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.How you doing? Listen, I don’t think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a… migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of – okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.Are you mental?I… don’t.And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.[teen approaches table] Hello there.Well it’s funny that you should ask, because it’s really more than a company…Dammit, Oscar!Yeah, I’m trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being “lured” these days. Thank you Dateline![answers cell] What do you want?Who cares? I’m not there, Jim’s not there, why should they have to be there?Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?This isn’t Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We’re dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.Yes. And don’t call me Shirley.All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar’s ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling][singsong] Just-in time.Just-in case. What’s your last name?This… just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she’s hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He’s the most… important thing in my life right now.I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.This is Darryl Philbin. Isn’t he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will “do” you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn’t bring are even better. Justin, I’m willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.No, I didn’t. You misconstrued me.I, uh, hmm.Why don’t… hey.Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I’d like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don’t even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that’s not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn… it. Okay, I’m gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.[standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they’re being distracted by the other booths.[clears throat] Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like…Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.Right here.  We have a lot of fun.[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.Check that out, huh?Pretty nice.She sits there all day.You get to look at her.  Why don’t you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.That’s called card stock.  That’s what you’re feeling.  Now what you’re feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration… You’re thinking, “Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?”  And I think we both know the answer.  We’ll find that out together.  You can keep that.Mmm, yeah.Don’t fold it, though.We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it’s sexy, it’s sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.  [to Pam]  I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  [Pam shakes head no]  So, sexy is fun…Hey, you know what?  Coincidence – I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?Yeah, me, too.Okay, be my guest.And do your worst.[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this…One other thing I wanted to…[laughs]  Ohh…Nah.Hey, Justin!Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?Okay.Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?Well, yeah, but you don’t need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it’s in here. [indicates heart]I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.I’m right.",
    "Oscar": "Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]We’ll see.Dunder Mifflin paper.Hey.Why, why wouldn’t you say that to her face?",
    "Darryl": "Hey, are we doing this thing?[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.What college did you go to Mike?Show them what you brought, Mike.Yeah, the booth is lame without it.",
    "Kelly": "Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I’m dating Barack Obama!",
    "Dwight": "Maybe he’s going to church. Or court.Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone… Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you’re going? Oh no, no, no. You’re not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will – [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.I will tell on you.Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]Michael, I know you’re swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.So… what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him][tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]You’re welcome.",
    "Pam": "[to Darryl] I think you look nice.So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn’t have to play basketball. Those were the days![holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that’s all we brought.There’s some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we… uh, eat a lot of cake![laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.He’s nice and he seems interested.I only brought the one.Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, “Are you sure Michael?” And you said “Pam! Pam! Pam!” And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, “Don’t worry, it’s just allergies.” Do you remember that?Okay. I’ll go look for another one. [she leaves]My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it’s still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.A piece of paper.Well I think they’ll get the spirit of it.Are you serious?Okay.Just checking in, how’s it going?I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.Talk to you later?Excuse me.[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]Well done.Hi.I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?Yeah. Can I fill out an application?I can do that.I don’t know any of those.New York or Philadelphia.All right. Cool, well… thanks.And uh, I’ll look into those.New York or Philadelphia.Okay.Thanks.Hi, nice to meet you.",
    "Michael and Darryl": "[simultaneously] Thank you.",
    "Jim": "Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I’d like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I’ve never done before. Try.Mr. Maguire, it’s been a couple of years.Great!Hey, so how’s the direct mail business going?Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-Absolutely, will do.So I guess I’ll just… work on my short game.You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.Yep.  [Maguire keeps swinging]Hey, can’t really talk now, what’s up?Uh, you know, we’ll see, we’ll see.Oh, I like you.Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?Absolutely.You know it’s a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don’t quit either, and I’d call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after …fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I’m feeling pretty good.I closed it!Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino’s.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.Yeah, well, you know…Cornell.",
    "Phil Maguire": "[takes golf swing] Whoa!Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, ’74 [goes to shake Andy’s hand]Yeah, you do.Guy’s kind of a douche.",
    "Andy": "Oh no!  No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir.  I am… totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell ’95.Oop, got some blisties.Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It’s actually not funny at all. It’s incredibly painful.[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let’s do this.People assume I’m great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my “knot” on.[swings] Dammit![Jim’s cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over]  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap![trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]Count me in!All right!Right on.[tries to break club over knee] Ow! Ow! [tries again] Owooh!",
    "Phil": "Let’s make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?I can’t complain, people love their junk mail.You know what Jim? I’m not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don’t we just play, okay?Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit!Yeah I’ll- I’ll get it out. Thank you.You can try. But I’ve looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn’t work. It’s just- it’s not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six.Let’s open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.No.I’ll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let’s talk then. Sound good?[chuckling] I guess.",
    "Kevin": "What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?I’m gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month’s rent.Andy, you’re up, let’s go!Yeah.Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive “bow-chicka-wow-wow” vocals]I’m gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I’m gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.He’s not my client.",
    "Meredith": "Guys, do we have to stay all day?",
    "Phyllis": "I mean, Michael’s gone, can’t we just go?What consequences?",
    "Creed": "Yeah, and I finished my work months ago![over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it’s Creed.Say, we’re gonna ditch this bitch. You in?Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin’s out, let’s go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]",

That’s what you said.You were kind of a jerk to me.And I’m, I’m gonna go now.I’m sorry, I’m sort of in the middle of this.[chuckling] Okay.Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of…Oh.That’s what the recruiter just said.",

    "Graphics guy": "Hello.Are you interested in graphic design?Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It’s really basic. We’re looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.[laughs] It’s actually not super-complicated. I mean I’m sure there’s some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you’re really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they’ve got amazing programs out there for design.Yeah.Sure.You should.Absolutely.It’s where the action is.",
