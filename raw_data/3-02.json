    "Michael": "Pam?Did you see Oprah yesterday?I, uh… I am going to be a father.Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.I know.Well…Just do it, okay?Um… find out if there’s a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?Eight months?I don’t even know if I’ll want a baby in eight months.You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven’t had a baby, and you haven’t had a baby…Twenty years.Thirty.It’s a deal.Yesh.Right there. Ah.Per diem.Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He’s been stuck working under Josh, the poor man’s Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.Sleep with who? Whom, whom… whom?Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.Yeah, do it!Really? Okay. Well, word of advice:unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?Um. Okay, um.You got that?Write it down.Um.Hey, Josh, how ya doing?Good to see you. There he is! There’s the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product… the progidal… my son returns.I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It’s like the firemen. You don’t leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.Yeah! Wow, I didn’t expect that. It’s good to see you too!Hey!Ah.Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I’m still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.That is crooked on that side.Hey hey!Yeah.Well, that’s how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain’t no party like a Scranton party, ’cause a Scranton party don’t stop.Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I’d love to be a part of one someday.All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.Ugh, that would be gross. It’s not even lunch yet.SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.Check it out. Hi, I’m Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.You know what? I’m having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.Well, cool! Okay, so… can I tell people you’re gonna be there?So maybe. See ya.Because he’s afraid to fly.Do you remember me from last year? There’s a party in my room, 308, can’t miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!Yep. Yeah, she’s up front.I don’t have to, I just know. Yes, hello?[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?I need you to do something for me.I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.And?Business has been pretty crazy around the office.Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.I will call him later with that message.Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.Hey, Jan, Jan? Don’t worry, I have got the tip.You’re welcome.No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.The party I’m having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.Any messages for 308? All right.Hey hey, fellers.What’s up?Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.Okay! Excellent. Oh…Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what’s up? Yep, yech… no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.You first.Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and… okay. Double or nothing.Well, let’s…Come on!Come on!Fine.Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it’s talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it’s moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I’m done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.Okay, let me tell you what we’re looking for.Sorry, my meeting ran late.Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.This is the party.Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.People have been filtering in and out.What?Sure. You like Cosmos?Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales… I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that’s just…I’m not better than Josh.Oh my God. You don’t even know. She’s single now.I’m sorry, man. I’m sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.Yeah.I will. I’ll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you’re feeling.Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.Evan, this is Jim.Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?Best friends.Some people need dozens of friends to say, “Hey, look at me, I’m popular.” But not me. I’m very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you’ll just know. Because a real relationship, it… it can’t be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael’s black light on] Ha, ha, ha.Whoa. What are those stains?Oh, God, I hope it’s urine.Today I’m headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.[Angela enters Michael’s office] Ah.Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it’s all about the Benjamins.[points to door] Right there.Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.Sure you don’t want to come?Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. “Connecticut.” And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer’s Vette, jump in the Vette, he, and I [laugh] I don’t make it to the car. [turns serious] Um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me… It was in the paper… [brightens] But to answer your question, yeah, I’m really excited about this weekend.See that factory?I almost worked there.Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.I was going to be a bottle capper.I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he’s doing now. He’s a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the… [laughs] He doesn’t even get to play in the game, I mean.",
    "Pam": "Yeah?No, I didn’t.What was Oprah about?That’s a really big decision.Maybe you should wait before you adopt.Or not adopt.Roy’s sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.Yeah.You probably won’t.No, Michael.No, Michael.Sure.This.Thank you.Yes, I have a date. He’s a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I’m kind of nervous. I haven’t been on a first date in nine years… probably shouldn’t broadcast that.I’ll probably just wear this.Um…Mm-hmm.Hey! What’s up?[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He’s not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What’s up?Okay. Well, if you think of it, I’ll be here.So how do you come up with your cartoons?You dream in cartoons? How fun!Huh.Freedom fries. Yeah.Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.More freedom fries.That’s great.I went on a date. It wasn’t a love connection, um… I think when I like someone again, I’ll just kinda know.",
    "Ryan": "All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.Uh, fun jeans.I don’t want ketchup.[reading checklist] Fun jeans.Fourth quarter projections for Jan?Will do.Yeah.[shakes his head]",
    "Angela": "Sign.But I don’t understand. It’s for managers.I know! It… I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?Don’t “Monkey” me! You can’t wait to get out of here, A. R. M.In the Martin family, we like to say, “Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.” That’s code for “check out the slut.” What is… why are there flies in here?That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.That town is full of history!Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.D?Sign.",
    "Dwight": "Don’t be mad, it is a business trip.Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.Yes, Monkey.And your veil.Um.I got it.I got it.Um.Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?Oh, hey, how’s it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?Shut up. That’s impossible.Well, I did it too.So what kind of commissions you get up there?You’re so immature!Hey, Jan.This party is going to be awesome.Check it out.Wow.I’ll do a shot, Michael.Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.I’m a huge fan.Why do they call him The Bus?Smile!You don’t have email on your phone.No one just called you.Yes. Anything.I’ll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there’s any known aliases, et cetera.He wasn’t volunteering today.Whoa. Michael.Was that your per diem?Hey, Michael.Keep the wing flaps.Come on. Nice try, Josh!Yes! Ha!Ha, ha, ha, ha.Blood, urine, or semen.Mm-hm.No!What would you have done? Been manager?You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]So, you ever been convicted of a felony?Misdemeanor?Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?",
    "Kelly": "Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?You look so pretty.Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.My neighbor Alan. They’re going on a date tonight.Alan’s cartoon is so funny, right?And they’re, like, so smart. I don’t even know what they mean half the time.So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.",
    "Dwight and Michael": "[singing] Um, um, um…",
    "Creed": "There’s my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?Andrea’s the office bitch. You’ll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.",
    "Meredith": "That town smells like cheese steaks.",
    "Josh": "Hey, Michael.Pretty good.Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I’m going to look for a place for you at Stamford.Yes.Okay.We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.Um, we should…All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.All right.Yeah, stop by later.Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope.

It’ll be…Thanks, but maybe another time.",
    "Jim": "It’s really good to see you, man.Yeah, sold about forty thousand.No, it’s not. I did. Yep.You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.Oh, Dwight. I’ve missed you so much.That is a lot of liquor.And a dart board.Oh, no, sorry, it’s an inside joke. There’s this bartender at Stamford who, uh… you know what?
