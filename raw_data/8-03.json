    "Dwight": "….back orders and you never called them.OK, you know what? I’m gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.There you go! Here doggy! He’s not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.Yeah, that’ll work.Bye poochie!Before taxes.I know what you’d do with all that money. [imitating Jim] “Hey Pam, let’s buy expensive bathrobes and hug.”I think we’ll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]Hey…OK no. No. That. You are so not…oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]Yup.[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What’s the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you’re right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.Like baboons or elephants.Kevin! Doesn’t apply.Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?Message in a Bottle, The Postman…Kevin Costner.It’s not the greatest one either…And it’s clear we’re not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]Exactly.Yep. He’ll be fine.Uh, it’s not totally empty.OK, I can see why you’re angry, you’re coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.I don’t know.OK. You know what? It’s been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.It’s uh, it’s in beta testing.Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.I know. Kevin, we’ve been friends for a long time, right?So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-I wouldn’t be asking you lightly, now would I?Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er…Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?Come on!",
    "Oscar": "Can you believe this?You can’t leave a dog in a parked car. [points to “I’d rather be snowboarding” bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.I bet this guy didn’t leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.This guy’s been gone long enough. He’s lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]Come on buddy, get back.And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]Why would we take the dog?Jim, he’s not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?At least.Really, nobody’s gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?Of course. I would. But my hip….I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]Bulk or definition?Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.Oh, he’s plenty strong.It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold’s Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.",
    "Erin": "There’s a dog in the car.As long as you guys don’t need me up here.I didn’t feel anything.[grabbing Kevin’s arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!And we did.Jim? Tell them what it’s called.Jim…Why’s it so far away?Yeah.You’re doing great! A little farther away from the wall!Good…",
    "Jim": "Do Snowboarders hate animals?Dwight! At least aim it.Whoa whoa whoa whoa!Alright! Nice job, Oscar!So…ah, who’s gonna take the dog?What if he jumps out the window and runs away?Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?Yeah, that’s pretty good.Nice job.Oh man, it’s gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.I mean, I don’t even know what I’d do with all that money.No, I’d probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I’d either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?Which ideally would be me….Stop. I’m a barista in your fantasy?I don’t know about Stephen King, I mean…Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you…OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That’s seventy-five boxes per person, so that’s not so bad.Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!There’s gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they’re not smart people.I’d go with that.Not that, don’t…It’s a great idea Kev, I don’t think it applies here though, so maybe we just-Our fake winningsIt is, yeah. I mean I just don’t know why I’m compromising if it’s my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it’s Maine and you love it.Nope. You’re, you’re doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]A…hot chocolate teaKevin Costner.Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]So, it’s not the dumbest idea.But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.So sadly, it’s the best idea on the table.Is he OK?OK, alright, that’s…look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.That’s alright.Doesn’t matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that’s stupid.That’s OK, we’re good.Porque es muy rapido.Right. It’s city and country combined.And I can fish right from the window of Pam’s pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.[laughs] Just like now….too bad the schools are terrible.But what are you gonna do about that?Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we’re basically there.Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.Dammit Dwight!Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don’t know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]Whoa whoa whoa!No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You’re way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.Good.",
    "Andy": "Oscar, it’s not that hot out.Well, we don’t know how long the driver’s been gone and it’s not in direct sunlight.We’re losing cloud cover.The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!…and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I’m the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I’m the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I’m the one who has to say those things.Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I’m gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin’ on the new warehouse guys?What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?Are they on their way over?This is kinda time sensitive.Alright, well until we have a new crew, let’s get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who’s in? [Erin raises hand]Are you volunteering?Jim! How ’bout you?Great. And Kevin.You look awesome.Where are we in the process?Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?You do have a fantastic basement.Right. Um, well how ’bout we take a look at some applications? …This guy wrote his in green ink, that’s pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go…there he is.That is not Darryl. I don’t know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK…Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?Well-Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you’re all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there’s any donuts out you can split one. You know they’re for everybody so people get fussy….You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so…Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren’t like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they’re gonna realize I don’t know what I’m talking about.We need you, OK?OK?Alright.Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we’re gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.Good. Keepin’ ’em honest.Are we scaring them straight….?Is everyone licensed?No. Warehouse license….Masters in warehouse sciences?…I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.No. Not joking. This is real….painfully real, what is happening right now.Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You’ll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um…No. Because they all left.I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn’t help.What are you talking about? I’m not gonna fire you.…..OK, this is weird. I don’t, I don’t get the joke.So Darryl says to me “fire me”. But what he really means is “I’m gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.” So I say “No, you’re not fired.” But what I really mean is “I have no idea what your talking about, but I’m gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.”……..I really hope that’s what he and I mean.Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who’s the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.Definition.Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America’s diminishing blue-collar workforce?Great….Well, it’ll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.Eh, cool. We’ll figure that out.Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That’s what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn’t ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.Surprise! Your new crew.Why? Because you didn’t win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?Yeah.Haha, what?I’m not gonna give you my job! It’s my job! I earned it! And here’s the thing, you weren’t even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.Nate! Please….thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D’Angelo, what happened to that?He didn’t die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I’d be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven’t asked me about it?None, no part of this has anything to do with you.Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.Hey. Here’s the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]OK what?Ah, OK.Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.What is goin’ on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]Why is the truck empty?No, Jim. Tell us why it’s called Señor Loadenstein.",
    "Darryl": "A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.[On phone] Hello?….Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin’ baby?….Nah. No no, I didn’t win. When I got promoted I stop-…what?…Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won….Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That’ll be-…What?….Oh, his number’s in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won … playing my birthday.I don’t know.No.I haven’t hired anyone.I’m not checkin’ email till lunch. Four hour work week.I got it. I’m doin’ it.When did I get so fat?I didn’t hire anyone if that’s why you’re here.I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of ’em. So I’d say we’re in the early stages of the process.The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can’t air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?Oh yeah.One of ’em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]I don’tNope. I’m good. I’m here. Let’s find some warehouse workers.OK.OK.Yeah.Why do you wanna work here?That’s not a good reason.Don’t just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it’s ten years later and you’re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it’s not gonna change.I hope so. Think about this carefully. There’s better lives than this one.I’ve never been lucky. And I’m not talkin’ about the lottery, I’m talkin’ ’bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?Did you hire ’em?What do you mean “they left”?Then I think you should fire me.Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.No? OK. I don’t wanna be here anymore. Fire me.Would you just fire me, man?You wanna make me happy? Huh?Give me your job.I’ll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.He died.I didn’t have time because of my daughter.Hey I’m not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.OK.OK, don’t fire me.My future’s not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It’s gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it’s gonna be mostly my bunch.Why is the forklift in the wall?Is that grease on my floor?And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?And?Let me see it.Let me see it!",
    "Kelly": "So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?Oh don’t try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.That’ll work.Bye. [Andy barks]Oh, god.I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year….I mean obviously I wouldn’t come in till noon and I wouldn’t do anything I didn’t wanna do. I mean I’m getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.",
    "Kevin": "Here, I’m gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.Good old Kevin. He’ll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.][On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I’m not gonna make it. I’m turning back.Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.Right. My mom-So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.I think we’re ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?Here…Oh hey guys.OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it’s cool cause we found another use for them.No Jim, tell ’em what a name is.[laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell ’em why it’s called that, Jim.Egons.No.However it’s normally done.Yeah Jim, why’s it so far?Back…That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!No no no!",
    "Meredith": "Whoa!Bye! [Kevin’s horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]We’re lookin’ at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.[under her breath] get a divorce…get a divorce…",
    "Pam": "What’s that come to? Like, what did they each win?Awesome.And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo…And then every morning, I’d walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting…And then my handsome husband…Would bring me a flavored coffee.Well in your fantasy we’re Stephen King characters.Oh, thank you.Wait, wait. What’s this? [holds up clipboard]It says “Lotto Pool”, right on top. [points to obvious title]Oh come on. You really think I’m gonna have a fourteen pound baby?No.Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]You came in at 10:30 today, right?So. I’ve been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings….And we move to the south of France. See? No, there’s plenty of bicycling for you. I think that’s where they do the Tour de France.Because I’m never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.We came to an agreement. We’re going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.Just like now.Oh..What are you gonna do?",
    "Phyllis": "That’s still a lot of money!Yeah.What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can’t lose this client.No..we don’tYeah, I lost my client.The first thing I’d buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It’s embarrassing.",
    "Ryan": "SoHo’s mostly lofts but OK.Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?Why not? What are you doing?Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.OK, (we’ll just dismiss it.)??????I’d give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can’t cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten’s not gonna make a difference. At some point, you’re just throwing good money after bad.",
    "Angela": "Sure.Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby’s birth weight pool.Yeah. And I said sorry.",
    "Female Applicant": "Your old crew won the lottery?Is this a joke?",
    "Male Applicant 1": "Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?I need a job.How much longer is this gonna take?",
    "Male Applicant 2": "Like a driver’s license?",
    "Gideon": "North America…and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That’s the headline version.FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.",
    "Nate": "Also, FYI, ah, I don’t techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there’s a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I’ll hear ’em as one big jumble. Uh, again it’s not that I can’t hear, uh because that’s false. I can. Um, I just can’t distinguish between everything I’m hearing.Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don’t have a hearing problem, it’s just when there’s a lot of noises…What wa-, what was the last…I’m havin’ a-",
    "Bruce": "Made it.",
    "Dwight, Erin, Jim & Kevin": "Uno! Dos! Tres! [Shot shows Jim & Dwight pulling ropes attached to a plank holding Erin in a helmet and boxes of paper down the greased runway, Dwight grunts]",
    "Creed": "I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.",
    "Toby": "I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.If I won the lottery, I don’t know. I don’t think I’d make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone…."
