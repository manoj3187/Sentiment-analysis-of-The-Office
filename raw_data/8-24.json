    "Oscar": "[to webcam] Hello. My name’s Oscar. I’m an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I’m gay. And I’m here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-No, it’s just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there’s a brighter future ahead.No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-Do you not own a mirror?Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it’s a simple-It’s not misleading.In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better… but better.What?David Wallace hasn’t worked here in years.Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me…",
    "Phyllis": "What’s he doing?Oh.[laughs] Yeah.Is it true you’re buying the company?So we’re not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?",
    "Dwight": "He’s searching out younger gays.…with you. [chuckles]You okay, Robert?Put some ice on it.I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, “muffin basket.” Then I thought, “Whatâ€™s even more precious to people than muffins?”…their own children.Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We’d love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don’t you bring by your little angel?Jim, you’ve got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!Great, right up there.Up here. [whistles]Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.That’s it.Cute kids, thanks for coming.Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.Nice to see you. May I hold him?Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby’s hairs are out of place.Really?Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don’t want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby’s fingernails are just bothering me-Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby’s cheek distracting to you as well?He defecated, aw.Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.Hello.They’re testing it now.Seventy-two hours.Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]",
    "Kelly": "Just keep chatting. I’m just checking my makeup in your webcam.Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.I’m throwing out all my mirrors.Now you look at me like you’re adoring me, I’m gonna look at the camera like I don’t even know you’re there.",
    "Pam": "I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.[enters with the kids] Family picture!What? Honey, we talked about this.Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?We decided that there’s no way Dwight would harm a child.No, no.But it’s free. And we’ll keep our eye on them.Yes!And we’ll make sure Dwight doesn’t do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.Yeah?Okay.Oh, great. Thank you.Okay.You ready?There we go.I’ll just stand here?See? That wasn’t so hard.You hit her?Oh, Andy.But have you ever actually seen him yourself?David, what are you doing here?",
    "Robert": "No, I’m sorry, I just can’t sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist--pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It’s a paradox to think of any sexual activity as “normal.” It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!Fine.Andrew, it’s time for you to go home. You’re better than this.Everyone’s better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why’d they add coconut? I miss original.Oof. [laughs] Wouldn’t wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I’m actually the CEO.Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.Likewise, I’m Bob. Bob Kazamakis.I’d love to give you a little rundown on what I’ve learned about this place.Please. [laughs]David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that’s very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I’ll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.Oprah Winfrey’s leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They’ve lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can’t even fathom.Yeah, so I’m hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it’s been fun.It’s been a great year.",
    "Kevin": "Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin’s nose] Ooh! [whimpers]Wait, C-R-A-Z…Even I know that’s weird.",
    "Sasha": "One, two, three!",
    "Jake": "Can you just smile, please?",
    "Meredith": "I don’t want to!Ouch. That’s gotta hurt!",
    "Angela": "No thank you.Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?Heh.Dwight.No. I am going to hold him because I haven’t seen him all day.I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby’s DNA to prove he’s the father. Which… is impossible… because the senator is the only man I’ve ever been with.[Phillip cries] See the duckie![slaps Dwight’s hand away] No. No. I like the baby’s hair the way it is.Uh-uh, leave us alone.Dwight, we’re fine!Oh no. [laughs]I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!No! God, Mose! God!Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!Where is it?How long does it take to get the results?You’re gonna wait here?[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can’t do this. Dwight!",
    "Jim": "I know why you’re doing this, Dwight.Last week, I may have gone too far. I’ll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And… you can fill in the rest.Now he’s trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it’s fair to be cautious.How’s it going, man?Great, yeah, good.Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?Pam? No!No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight’s photo studio slash trap.No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.Nope.But are you a hundred percent sure? I don’t think any of us are.Nope.That’s-That’s-Okay.Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.Alright. Why don’t you just--give him to me and… perfect.This is great.Excuse me.Just do it.Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.Let’s do it, shoot it.Great.Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh, so that’s it?No, no, see? This is what we’re talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you’re not drunk…Oh boy.Andy, come on.Hey.Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.",
    "Darryl": "Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.Aw, come on. What’s the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?The coconut’s pretty subtle.I don’t know, man. Y’all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y’all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn’t give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.A lot has changed since y’all left, okay? You’re gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she’s one of the best we’ve ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?I would.Yeah.Yes, I am. Just so everyone’s on the same page.Good slam.Good luck to you.[taking photo with Jada] Let’s see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]Cool.",
    "Hide": "Bad economy. Bad investment.Coconut penis.",
    "Calvin": "They did not.I wouldn’t.Come on, man. Can’t you just give us a yes or a no?",
    "Andy": "[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.[whimpering] I’m- I’m good, thank you. And how are you?Look, I’m not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I’m moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants…Clean the toilets.Pull the poop out of the toilets.Just, please…Please!Give me something!Thank you.Thank you.I have a delicious secret.Yeah, it is actually.Mmm, I can’t hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o’clock today he’s gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It’s go time.Hey Nellie, I made soup – I made you some soup.But it’s really good- [drops soup] Oh!A delicious moment.Well, but it-I just want you guys not to worry. ‘Cause old Andy’s gonna be just fine.No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.That’s not true either! That’s also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you’re gonna like this surprise guest.[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what’s the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday… that’s not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!I’m not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum “Suck It” to the U.S. military.I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.Stop saying my name.Thank you, Erin.Erin, come- Come on. You know I’ve been talking to David Wallace.Yeah, I know.What? Thought I heard my name. What? I’m the new manager?But it’s- it is- it is me? Right?What?Oh my God!Wow. From janitor to manager?That’s quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.From total loss to total boss, I mean-I was so looking forward to that and it did not… go as I thought it would.Guess I’d better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.Gosh, I hope so.Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever’s on your mind.No.Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?Gymnasts? You’re going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]",
    "Gabe": "Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!",
    "Nellie": "Oh God.No, you don’t understand-I don’t need anyone to-That’s not even a thing.Andy.Andy.Why don’t you clean the carpets for today?You’re welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.You don’t need to-Well, I don’t want any soup.Oh come on, Andy!You’re dirty, you stink of booze, you’re limping inexplicably.What?Oh, get out, skeleton man!May I say one thing?The quality of mercy is not strained.It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. ‘Tis mightiest in the mightiest.Special projects manager, that’s my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.",
    "Creed": "Good, good. This carpet’s overdue for a good mopping.",
    "Photographer": "Sir, could you look into the camera?Sir.",
    "Senator Lipton": "Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there’s one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it’s a good photo op.Thanks.Sure.Oh, thank you.I guess we’re okay with the fingernails.Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?I’m just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.You’re stinky.Okay, shall we take a few more?Okay. There we go.Hey.You didn’t call.You know what this is about. [covers Phillip’s eyes] Call.",
    "Erin": "Okay, you’re going to go through the hallway. Here’s a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]I know this is going to be a great payoff.But after you’re manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.No, unfortunately it’s true. He’s been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he’s been taking it out on me.He’s not hitting me. But, he’s been verbally abusing me-No, he’s not making this up.Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.Oh my God.",
    "Brandon": "That’s some pretty blatant complementing you’re doing there, man. I don’t even talk to her like that.You would?Sounds like you’re trying to hit on my girlfriend.[scoffs] So you really think she’s gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?Thank you, Biggie.Oh, and have a burger for me.",
    "Val": "Uh, Brandon?Calm down, he’s not.Brandon![stands next to him] Right here?",
    "Toby": "Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.I can refer you to someone to talk to.Give you a name or-Hey, Andy, Nobody’s calling you crazy, Andy. We’re your friends, Andy.Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?",
    "Ravi": "I do adore you.",
    "Others": "Hey!",
    "David": "Hey guys, long time.Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I’ve been talking with Andy-I’ll get to that in a second, Andy.Yes, as we’ve discussed-But it’s very possible-Probable.Yep.There’s an official announcement, a few details to be-Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett’s planning on liquidating the rest of the company.Ah, I didn’t realize you were standing there.Well, okay. Great to meet you.Pleasure.That’s very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there’ll be no need for him.But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he’s gonna be freed up to do something much more important.I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.",
