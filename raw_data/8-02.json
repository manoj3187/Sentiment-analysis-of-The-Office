    "Jim": "Hey, so this isn’t matching up with this…and I’m not sure which one’s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?Alright.Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?Yeah, alright Kev why don’t you come with us?Does it save time though? ‘Cause we’ve been here for about an hour.K, Kevin, are you saying “See the world”? or “Sea World?”No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it.How many L to a K?I’ll take five.[Andy walks in with ties on his arm]Your ex-wife?Wow. Alright. Can’t wait to meet her.Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim’s desk, kicking things in the process.]Why don’t you start?He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door…She looks at it when she’s on the potty, and she makes the faces.We know that.You have a walking buddy.What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?But, what if?I don’t know, for such a crazy number I’d like something pretty crazy.That’s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case…let’s get to work.[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?Ok.Andrew.No, I didn’t notice anything.I don’t know what to tell you, man.Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.Nah, you definitely weren’t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]Yeah. Big sale. Don’t worry about it though, I don’t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though…[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald…can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt][on the phone]and I’m back. How are you sir?….I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?Gettin’ psyched up?Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this…I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun….and you did that.But I think it’s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea….which, by the way, I can’t wait for.Absolutely not.Pull up your pants.I’d hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70’s theme party, or a 70’s theme meeting, or a 70’s theme convention…1870’s…Nope, he means tuna dog.",
    "Kevin": "Yes. Me do.Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.You keep think that.Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say “car no go”, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?Thank.But save time. More success.No me fault.Many small time make big time.See world.See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.Fine, fine.  I’ll talk normally.When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?[Group murmurs, offended]Well I’m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don’t know the woman.This is where we goIt’s a answer.There are no wrong answers.Don’t! oh, you must think…I’m not. I’m using the fax, this isn’t, no wait.  I’m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There’s usually an Erin here.So…DARRYL! A GIRL!Kevin.No!Don’t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]For sure.  [murmurs from group in agreement]",
    "Pam": "Kevin, do you feel OK?Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.No he hasn’t.Kevin, at most you’re saving a microscopic amount of time.Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.It’s huge.  How much does it weigh?Erin, you don’t need to call him that.Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici’s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.I flipped through it.Of course.Yeah.That sounds nice.I do.Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.Oh. [smiling]Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman’s?Where’s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] “I’m not as think as you drunk I am!” [crowd claps and cheers]Do Not Resuscitate…[mild cheering]Oh, and then this was Phyllis’s idea…[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!We were hoping you could do something like this…Baby.Yes.Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.Just a few adjustmentsUm, what should we talk about?Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.Angela, that’s pretty transparently me.You know it’s just herbal tea.Yeah. I think you should call social services.You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we’re in this together.Fine.I don’t like that clip.",
    "Oscar": "No, guys.He’s fine.He’s making a statement. It’s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.…”C-SPAN”?Let me call you back.We don’t get it.Really?",
    "Angela": "No, he’s fine.He’s always been like that.I mean, he’s gotten worse over the years….Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you’re pregnant?I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?Great.[Angela walks away]Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I’m having.A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don’t know if I should call social services about it.Maybe.In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!I already did.Fine.",
    "Andy": "Kevin, I appreciate what you’re trying to do.Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we’re talking about is…basically the speech equivalent… to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use…but need need for talk talk.What are you gonna do with all this time?Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight’s meeting.I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties…and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause……I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I’m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog…had to pull rank.[to Robert California] Hi Dad!…… Ahhh….oh boy.Are you factoring in the… whole national …economy…. declining and all that?I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor….vanilla?You were saying you chose me…. There was a reason?Can I inspire? [laughs] I don’t know!…..I don’t know.[Erin enters with overflowing cup of coffee]Why don’t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.I’ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm….I do.You know, we’ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we’re in this weird dance….You got it.Done.Neither am I, it’s already done.  Hah, I’m just kidding, it’s going to take some time.What’s up, guys? Just thought we’d have a little rap session, talk about business…see how things are going? Ahem…If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert…man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how’s the sales doubling …project going?OF course not.  There’s no magic button.  You have to summon that.Dwight, anything?You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.Fart….. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg’s asleep.D-Bone. There you are.No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about…I know, right?Yeah…um, how is everything?Must be a tough time to be a family farm.Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?There’s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales…Thanks for coming in guys.Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I’m gonna thank people.This is what’s under the blanket.These are incentives.  It’s how we’re gonna double growth. Now, you’re probably all asking yourselves: “Well, how does this work?”You’re exactly right and you get a point.Twenty points.I’ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.There’s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.I can’t.Ooh I didn’t mean to offend you, and I hope you’ll forgive me because I am very very… Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.That’s a crazy amount of points.Well, what do you want?Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]I’ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]Swear to God, hope to die. Now let’s get to work!T-bag bone…Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years….and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.You think it has something to do with that incentive program?Bah…I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.Hundred and twenty points.Hey Kevin, what are you doing?[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ’95. Hey there, um, I’m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here…De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale…uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I’m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs][Erin fills in drawing showing points, crowd cheers and claps]Took ‘em one day.OK, keep in mind, it’s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points….or best offer.We should think about this…does anyone have any better ideas?Just need a second outside.Yeah.Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ….Confession: I don’t know what I’m doing.My ass is only so big, I mean I can’t do this everyday.No one expects me to go through with this, right?Let’s ink…my stink! [crowd cheers]My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.[Andy removes his pants][lying on table] Do your worst!They are already off, my good sir.Well, I think down’s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!AHHHHH!!!!!!![removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It’s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That’s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!When you’re a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that’s crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I’m manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.Which combo do you think Robert’s gonna like better?This is combo number seven.You’re right, you’re right, you’re right. Uh! It’s so hard to find an occasion for this clip.Sure.Thanks T-Dog.Tuna dog!I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like “Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas” Well I don’t know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don’t have any bombs.[sighs] Yeah.I don’t have any ideas though.You do?Yeah….I don’t think that’s legal. It’s a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?You didn’t have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain]You’re the only person who’s congratulated me.",
    "Dwight": "This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet….the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]So, you can tell your clients: “Unleash the power of the pyramid.”Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it’s barely three pounds.Fifty L.You’re really going to want the booster.Thank you.Is this really the best use of our collective time?[to group] OK, let’s look at some ties.Here’s how I’m going to help out from now on. I’m going to not care, and I’m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy’s inevitable demise.[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they’re out of the house.Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie…?  Lick the spoon?Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don’t see the point. It’s so Wall Street.Right?Good. Really really good.Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.I don’t know, what do you mean?You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I’ll do mine….. walnuts?Yeah!Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I’m gonna like it.DRAW SOME BLOOD!",
    "Phyllis": "Ooh, why is it shaped like that?Andy, don’t make us sell this stupid thing.Wait….they’re terrified?Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can’t just press a magic button.You don’t have to thank us for coming in, it’s our job.[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen’s bananas.What else you got?Just wear one of your bowties.",
    "Ryan": "How much memory does it have without the booster?I’m sorry,” L”?Uh, is that a vibrator?I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]T-Dog?",
    "Stanley": "How on earth are we supposed to sell…?If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  You’re not making any sense.How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.[On the phone] You’ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!I like what we have.",
    "Erin": "Um, D-Dog, you have a message.Andy wants us to, P-Dog.Justine.  She said she’s coming by later.Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you’re here?Oh, sorry.Oh[Erin sets cup down and Robert sips it]Yeah.  It’s old. [smiling]I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said “coffee”….Andy, you don’t want that.Sorry.Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]Yeah.Hey. Maybe it’d help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.Well I have an idea.What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You’d get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart’s.I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don’t know why. I made it into a key chain.",
    "Darryl": "It’s ok E-Dog, just who called?No no no no.  I like her.Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.I’ll introduce you.Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can’t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night…. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.[Singing] rub a dub dub…I got scrubbed.  ‘Sup, darlin’? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I’ve been thinking about you all mornin’.  I don’t know what you did, I can barely walk today.",
    "Robert": "Hello, Andy.  Excellent tie.I’d love some coffee.I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.Andy, do you know why I chose you?Vanilla? No no no no.  You’ll never guess in a million billion years you’ll never guess.Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?Oh! Thank you. Uh….You can just put it down.That is very cold.Why would I…..?You like her.She likes you.[interrupting] I’m afraid you’ve lost my interest.If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?[Kevin Raises hand]Ah…[chuckling] Oh, you’d go someplace else.  That’s not it, that’s not the answer.It’s a wrong answer.Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it’s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don’t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You’ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them “you are welcome.” [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.Double.I’m not kidding.Double.[Andy knocks on Jim’s desk]Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he’s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.There’s something about an underdog that really inspires…the unexceptional.",
    "Meredith": "I gotta go.Hi.What’s with the blanket?[Andy removes blanket over table to reveal various items]How does one get a point?Looks good.",
    "Justine": "Hello. I’m looking for Darryl Philbin?Ok….?Can we…. go some place private?",
    "Kelly": "Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It’s so gross.This point system is really insulting.That’s a tablecloth.No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options…Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They’re for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It’s like yeah Tucker, you’re so street.",
    "Group": "Ooooh!Whoa!",
    "Tattoo Artist": "So, coming out of his butt is a…Baby…Yeah, no problem.Uh, you can keep your pants on actually…if just drop ‘em down a bit, that’d be great.I’d really prefer they not be down.OK, you want me to…Alright, let’s begin.That was just the cotton swab.",
    "All": "Hmm, no.",
    "Toby": "I thought I was T-Dog."
