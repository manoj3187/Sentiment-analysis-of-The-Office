    "Michael": "Kahlua Sombrero, please.Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I’m a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.Oh, really?And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.Do not tell my fiance I’m drinking on a Wednesday.I’m moving out to the burbs… actually, I’m moving further than the burbs, I’m moving to Colorado.Yep. Don’t mess with Colorado.No, no. I don’t want to end up like Sunny Bobo.You know, I would like to try the luge, through.That’s what I’ve heard.Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?Really? What happened?Oh… wow. The mountains. Where things are.Man, he is late. I’m gonna call him. Do you mind? I’m sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo’s phone vibrates]No, I’m here. I’m right… I’m at the bar.You are? What bar?I… do not see you.I’m been here about… gosh, over half an hour.What’re you wearing?Are we both at the right place?I hear your voice.I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.Wow… that is insane! [laughter][entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?Alright! Here we go!This is it. What do you think?[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it’s own sake. So, without further ado, let’s start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!Come on out!I am well, sir, how are you?And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it’s Deangelo the whole time!I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!Oh yeah… I know… that’s what I was just saying… that’s what…This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.Yes it was.Are you kidding? I’d come anywhere to see a turtle? Where’d you find him.You know me very well, Dwight.Now I’m gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I’ll be off all day.So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!I sorta like the old way.I know, I know, I’m sorry, but if it’s not a big deal we should just-Is that good?Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings][to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael’s face, none on the neck]It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.Well, we don’t really do rap sessions. We kinda do… [Erin shaves Michael] god… we sorta do more of like powwows or-That’s-You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can’t say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don’t even really have to worry about.Don’t shave my lips.You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so… you know, let’s not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I’m still here-I still have to look at this stuff, guys.Deangelo’s great. I love the guy. But I’m not sure he’s a great fit for the office. And also, I’m not sure if I love the guy.[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It’s the witching hour! It’s the sandwitching hour!PB and J, my mom’s recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin’s open mouth]What?Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.No, that’s good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.No, it’s not insane, Oscar. I’m been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you’re gonna throw it all away? No.Well, who needs him. Guess it’s just you and me, Dwight.I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you’ll be fine.Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.You’ll figure it out.",
    "Waiter": "All right, so just you tonight?",
    "Deangelo": "I’ll drink to that. I’m starting at a company this week.To begginings and endings.The moms and the troops.[laughs] I won’t… I don’t know her.Colorado! The sunshine state.Doing some skiing?Well that’s just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.Try it once, you’re hooked. That’s my guess.I’m an olympics nut.[holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you…You know, it’s funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?That’s the way it goes.Excuse me. Hello? You running late?I’m at the bar too.I’m at the bar. The bar that’s located in the lobby of the hotel.How long have you…Ok, me too.I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.Which place?I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.Deangelo Vickers.That is insane, that is the right term. Let’s get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.I am ready.Oh, she’ll do. She’ll do just fine.I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune…Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I’m serious![blinds roll down, Deangelo waving]Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it’s a part of me. I’ve learned to cope with it. What else, I’m just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-[picks up paper] I’ll help you.Hello!No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.[offers Kelly the papers as she walks away]Oh. [chuckles] That was… let’s see, where’s my replacement? Where’s the guy I’m replacing? Why don’t I look to the left? He’s sitting right there! [office laughs][silences Michael][laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter]Here’s the great thing about the southwest; there’s so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you’ve ever seen.I did not.Sounds very interesting, thank you.Why do you use your name when you use the phone?Try it without using your name.Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I’ve got to start doing some managing at some point.And it really isn’t.Well, I’d like to change it, actually.I think a change would be nice.Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can’t even look at you.Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can’t wait to hear the punchline.I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It’s not even close.Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn’t it?Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.Ok, then, powwows then, fine.You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I’m sorry.No, no, no, I know what you’re doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?[Andy walks into room] What’s up?Let’s not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.[laughter] Now that’s funny! That’s funny! You walk much?Little click…Thank you. That’s my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.Oh, that’d be great, thank you Stanley!Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?[laughs] Drink some soap![laughter and applause]Best whale watching:easily the west coast. If you’re going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called “West Coast Whales’. [laughter] Because you’re not gonna see them-I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.[uses book to stop the sandwitch’s flight] You’re getting nut particles all in the air![steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.[walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or…?Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you’re leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn’t accept hug] Ok. [walks back]I… I’m adequete. I’m half as good as you.Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You’ve worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It’s Lake Havasu time!Ok. What is the Native American girl’s name?That’s a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled ‘Babys I Don’t Care About.’",
    "Deangelo/Michael": "[in unison] Summer![looking up from phones in unison] Sorry…",
    "Oscar": "Michael is leaving. And apparently they’ve already hired a new manager. And we’re meeting him today. It’s a lot to process. Paperwork wise.You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?Well, Deangelo, I’d say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?Michael, This is insane.",
    "Kevin": "[wearing wig] Nope! It’s not Ashton Kutcher. It’s Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]Burnt! It’s lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.Interesting.Awesome!",
    "Dwight": "Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.Thanks for meeting me.There’s no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.That’s because I’m your right-hand man, Michael, but I can’t do it again. I can’t do it again for a whole new guy.I want to be manager. I just don’t understand why I wasn’t even interviewed for the job. What’s wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.How do I become a manger at Sabre?I left a message at corporate.Can’t you just use the recommendation you already have on file?From when he recommended me to replace him.Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.",
    "Kelly": "[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I’ll get that you guys. Don’t… it’s just… you know…Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]Have we met before?Well, I guess I’ll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.And that is what you call a meet cute.",
    "Darryl": "Kind of embarassing.It’s cool that you like the southwest. It’s one of my favorite regions.It’s one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.I love the desert. It’s one of my favorite ecosystems.Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.No, I’m good. Keep them.",
    "Angela": "Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he’s a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He’s a great person to know.Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.",
    "Andy": "That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up ‘Hello, my name is..,’] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.I wasn’t even trying to make a joke. But I guess I’ve always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.Here we go… ok… what do African Americans call… [laughter]I… don’t know. Help me.I don’t mean to go into a rant here, but…I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.…I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don’t. I’m thinking, ‘how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.[leans on table] I wasn’t taking a position. It’s just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly][mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let’s see if they have my favorite teas in here… [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants][drinks hand soap]I guess this is my life now.",
    "Pam": "Well, it wasn’t an affair.But, no, but we are a family.Cecelia.Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.Da-das.See, we knew it! If he just met her, he’d understand.",
    "Jim": "[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.Yeah, they don’t ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them ‘da-das’.And what happens here is-We were… I think she was just trying to-Wait, so, you don’t go into shock or die or anything?Listen, you’re the one who decided to leave. Come on, he’s the new boss, you know we have to do this.Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?Thank you very much.We’re back in! Right?",
    "Meredith": "That apple looks delic!",
    "Stanley": "Deangelo, you’re going to starve to death. [laughter]Need a hand?What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?",
    "Erin": "Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.Oh, that’s how Pam does it. I just copy her. She’s sort of a living legend.Dunder Mifflin, this is… oh, I like it!Oh, assist.Yeah, ok, good.What do you think?[picks up phone] …I’m so sorry. Sorry.

    "Gabe": "First thing’s first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would’ve just looped back to me, so, it’s cool you recognized my role here.Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That’ll put you right on the shortlist for next time there’s an opening.What recommendation?…I’m sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.",
