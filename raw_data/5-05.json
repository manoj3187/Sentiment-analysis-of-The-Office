Will you help walk me to the fax machine?Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?Oh, from the insurance commercials!So, you’re dumping Michael? Smart.Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That’s so romantic!",
    "Phyllis": "[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]Sure.I’m sitting right here Dwight.I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we’re in the same building.",
    "Ryan": "I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.Gordon Gekko.… Yeah.‘Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.",
    "Oscar": "[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.We’ll miss you.[chuckling] Isn’t it a seven-hour drive?I don’t know if it’ll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That’s an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you’re up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It’s another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there’s no traffic, because….Okay.Bye.",
    "Creed": "Let’s put a smile on that face!It’s pronounced Ker-nell. It’s the highest rank in the military.",
    "Kevin": "[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I’ve been up since four!Well, Hol, this is it.[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies][whispers in Holly’s ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.",
    "Andy": "[dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet ‘stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?Cool.[buzzer noise] We were looking for “kitten.”Ha ha ha. That’s funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you’re not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn’t wear them.Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?Well he’s had a pretty good season so far— Stop saying “we.” You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you’re just doing this to screw with me.I know it’s an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]Take. That down.I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.It’s pronounced “Corn-ell!” It’s the highest rank in the Ivy League!Fine.Yeah, good. Can we— [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That’s Big Red Bear! That’s a bobble Big Red Bear! God!![outside men’s room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]Dwight!Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it’s irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won’t let you in?Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.The conference room!Who are your role models?If I had to put Dwight’s chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You’re doing great.Let’s see how well you know your Big Red history.Who was Cornell’s eighth president?Mm, I’m sorry that’s incorrect. Cornell’s seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.What are you writing? Can’t even give Cornell your full attention?Nobody wants …that, to happen.“Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.”“Applicant is wasting everyone’s time with stupid and inane accusations.”“Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.”I have everything I need- [talking over each other]And you will be hearing from –which I will not be a part of-And YOU will not be pleased with the result!And your affiliation with Cornell –Will end completely![Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls]  I thought I’d come in casual today. Man, I’m hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?What, these?  Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You’re supposed to cook these, aren’t you?I don’t care, so it doesn’t matter.You don’t think he could get in, though….right? I mean, I don’t care, but I just don’t see how he could. I doubt he could get in.I don’t care either way, so….shut up.[in parking lot on cell phone] Don’t tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don’t do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You’re an alum. This guy, he’s….he’s poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I’ll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.",
    "Jim": "Dave.You are?  [Andy hisses] A cat?[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.Hey New York, Happy Halloween!Oh, I’ll walk you out.All right. We’ll see. [to camera] No.I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.Hey, how are you?Good to see you.All right so now we can sit… and get comfortable.That’s not really true. There’s a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.Wow, that’s- that’s a little rude. What’s your deal?Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She’s a trumpeter. And, look at her.That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?Love that one.Here you go again! What is your deal today?One.Half.Also good.Pete couldn’t make the Mets. She’s at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?Pam, don’t worry about it.Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]Well, I’ll be the judge of that. What do you got?That is good.Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. “Pam cool. Welcome to the family.”",
    "Pam": "Hey.Thanks.  My costume’s getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can’t even take off my hat, because then I’m Hitler.Hey!How are you Tom. Nice to see you.I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they’re into the idea. They’re probably thinking, “That Pam Beasly, she’s the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She’s the best! The absolute best.”Okay, so here’s what I’m thinking. I’m gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn’t in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?Okay, okay.Oookay….They came up with that idea really fast.Hey guys.Hi! [smooches]Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]Cute.Miles Davis.Chet …something.Dizzy Gillespie.I don’t know if I’m gonna make any money with art.I mean it’s a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don’t try now, I never will. So…… Got you.For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it’s very subtle.Thank you.Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?",
    "Dwight": "[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I’m gonna make a pencil disapp– oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.Good morning temp.Thought I’d go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?Andy.No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I’m applying!Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]Hey there. So uh, how do you think we’re gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford’s arm looks pretty strong.Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn’t have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.Someday, we’ll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.Excuse me?Andy, let’s just talk about this man-to-man, after work.What do you say?Andy, I’ve been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go’s?That’s a conflict of interest.[thinks] Interview.What?Okay.Bring it.Dale Raymond Corson!Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]On the contrary, I’m helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.Well, when they get my evaluation we’ll see if they’re interested.“Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.”“Interviewer has suspect motives.”“Interviewer has turned off applicant’s interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.” Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.And you will be hearing from the –-Cornell Application Department,And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]And your affiliation with Cornell –Will end completely![has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.Where did you get those?I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can’t do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn’t know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.No, but it’ll make you respect him less.",
    "Michael": "Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat’s Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.Road trip!  Right?Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.We’re not.We’re not doing anything.All right everybody. I’m out of here. Jim, you’re in charge.Ah, you are quite the gentleman.You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.Cool!We’re gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we’ll just meet in the middle. It’ll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?All right. What’s the scoop, how far?Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.Yeah. I don’t know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.Here we go, fourth time’s a charm. “Life’s like a road where you just… one day here, and the next day back…Sometimes you deal with it, today you don’t, sometimes you do, what you want… there’s a world out there…. [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?Allergies?Did Darryl touch you?What’s the matter?Sure it is.Oh no no no.. It’s gonna work, it’ll be fine.Listen to me. I like you so much.And I’ve dated four women in the last–Not last – no. In like the last ten years.I’ve dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.That’s what she said.Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I’m gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.Yeah.Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we’re talking constantly all the way.I’ll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.Maybe I’ll see an accident one weekend?Years!Yeah.Here’s my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you’ve met me, and you are happy.You know what? I think we’re a great couple. I think we’re a classic couple. I think we’re like Romeo and Juliet. I think we… go together so well.  We’re like peanut butter and jelly, don’t you think?Then don’t do it. Please don’t do this. Please don’t do this. [they continue arguing]I don’t know what I’m gonna do!Please?I’m not gonna be okay.No I won’t! I’m not strong! And I’ll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!Oh that’s mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I’ll just ride back with you.I’ll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?So um… I think I’m gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay.

This is gonna be awesome. I’ve decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.[playing cat’s cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one?[laughs]Fair enough.Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the ‘hood?Cow surfing?Really?Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there’s a cow.Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.[reaching to open door] I’m gonna do it.The man has a point.[visibly shocked] What? Why?[gasps] I do! Hey, come on!Jackson Five.[rubbing noses with Holly] You’re the one.You are.No, you are.You’re the best.You’re better. You’re better than my best.Here we go.Okay, Ready?Watch this. Darryl, watch this.YeahYeah. Right, snuggle time.[makes squeaking sounds]Here’s what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It’s like another seven hours.Speak.Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.Come on, it’ll be fun.[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn’t that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.Say what you said.[laughs] I’ll save you! I’m Superman! Scooperman!I didn’t ask.We want the same things.That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.Seven deadly sins. It’s a sign.[standing with Holly next to “Welcome to New Hampshire” sign] Oh, it’s really cold here.Yeah.[starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked.Oh, you have your own entrance. That’s nice.",
    "Holly": "Oh, look at all this stuff! It’s only seven hours.Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.Breaker one-nine, copy?Kidding.It’s been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said “Well, why don’t you quit and get some job in Nashua?” And he said “I asked you first.”  And I said “First!” at the same time he did. And then I said “Jinx.” And then we never talked about it again and haven’t been back to the conversation. So…I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!Yeah it did look shorter on the map-You were sleeping?  You were talking before.We’re only halfway?Let’s check there.No.No.No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]It’s not gonna work.There’s too much distance.Michael we’ve only been dating each other for a few weeksAnd I like you too.I’ve dated four guys last year too.Oh.Michael. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t make it harder than it has to be.If you leave on Friday, by five, you’ll be rolling in at… midnight? At best?And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.Oh.Well-How long could we keep that up?Years?Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?[kisses his temple] Thank you.I do, I think so.You’ll be okayYou will.Okay. Bye.Well, I’ll be around.It’s not that bad. But if I’m really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]Okay.Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin][pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that’s not gonna happen.No, we’re gonna do the long-distance thing.Yeah, thanks.Oh, well….look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.[talking head] It’s a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker’s helper.[chuckling] No, that’s not what you’re grabbing.Put….okay….Sorry, Darryl.All right.Were there even cows where you grew up?[grabs Michael’s arm] No, Michael. It’s not a real game.Darryl….No, you.You are.You are more.You’re better.You’re better than betterest.[plants kisses all over Michael’s face]Hold your breath!Look, Darryl, lip up.Down, and give me 50![hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!Snuggles.Spooning.Mmm hmm.Ooh!We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?Mmm.Yeah.No, Michael. I don’t….[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I’m gonna puke!Darryl didn’t want any?I know, but from seven hours away.Michael….I’m an atheist. Did you know that? I don’t know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven’t even had yet.Oh, it’s just later.[unlocking front door] This is me here.",
    "Darryl": "Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.Mike you’ll drive this every weekend?This trip was longer than I thought.Not really.Four hours. Almost halfway there.Next exit isn’t for five miles.There’s nothing out here man.WHAT!?Clever, Mike.[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what’s up, I just thought I’d try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.Please call me back.Please…[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There’s another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.This is the last of it.You’re not staying?But you want me to put it back in the truck.I know it’s hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.Looked like it. Sometimes when I’m down like this, it helps to sing the blues.[bluesy] Da na na na na…  da na na na  na…Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na… want to do that?That’s when you hit me with what’s getting you down, okay?Da  na na na na.Da  na na na na.No, wait. You’re, you’re supposed to… Never mind. Da  na na na na.Da  na na na na.Da  na na na na!!Da  na na na na .Yeah!  Da  na na na na.YEAH! Da  na na na na.[talking head] I’m driving them up for five times what I would’ve made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I’m gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.[driving truck] Hey, y’all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.It’s like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?You gotta include me in the conversation.If you don’t mind.I got a game. Cow surfing.Spot a cow, last person to say “Jackson Five” has to get on its back and ride it.Everybody got a government cow.Here we go. Go get him, Mike!Then why did you say “Jackson Five?”All right, I made it up.Because I wanted you to like me.[trying not to laugh] Okay.[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera][rubs face in exasperation][setting stopwatch] Go.[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it’s quiet.Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.You know.There you go.Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.Thank you. Thank you. No.Hey, y’all wanna hear some loud music or something?Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That’s crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?[holding camera] Here we go.Stairs. Oh, man….",
    "Michael and Holly": "Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.",
    "Michael, Holly, and Darryl": "If you’re going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you’re going my way…",
    "Tom": "Hey, future baby sis!I’m good.Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.The other thing would “get” Jim.Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.Pam, I haven’t seen you in so, so long!So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.Yeah. Right Pam?Yup. She only knows how to play “When the Saints go Marching In.”You don’t!We pranked you!",
    "Pete": "That’s perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?That, is awesome!Oh yeah.I think this is better.This is nicer, it’s fun. It’s fun!Nice to see you again, Pam.Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?Hey, just having fun Jimmy.Yeah but, she doesn’t think she’s gonna be like, career musician right?Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides… Louis Armstrong?The point is Pam, is there are jobs-And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don’t see me try to get on the Mets.I’m just calling it like I see it.It was Pam’s idea. Pam was the mastermind.That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.",
    "Meredith": "You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.",
    "Stanley": "What?",
    "Angela": "Yes, we’ll email you, and then you’ll have our addresses.He’s just trying to push your buttons.Great, then it doesn’t matter.[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.He’s just….Why are you doing this to Andy?[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that’s not going to make me leave Andy.[sighs] Yes, that’s true.",
    "Holly & Darryl": "[in unison] Jackson Five!",
    "Holly & Michael": "[both laugh hysterically at portable DVD player on dashboard while Darryl drives, looking miserable]",
