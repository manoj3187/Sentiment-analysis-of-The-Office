I love my job. I-I love wrestling.[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language][running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed…[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first “B” stand for?We’re making acronyms. Okay! What does the first “B” stand for?I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U…] All right! The “O”…[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I’ve got some bad news. We’re going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this][takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]It’s Creed. FYI, I’m starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?Hehehe, cool. Let’s keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don’t want you to be a dead mamma jamma.All right, thank you, bye-bye.You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.I think you two should meet.Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]It’s Kismet!",
    "Jim": "He never called a meeting.[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?Really?[waiting for Fred to continue] …What is it?You could just be saying it to get the job.How about this. Why don’t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.Okay.Did you just trademark that…We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch’s new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone’s bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an “Andy for Manager?” pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I’m not too worried. But I’m really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe’s last name was Lewis? I had no idea.Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.Can you… [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence… would be… in a dialogue with a subordinate?Yes.Yes.[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?[ignoring Darryl’s question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we’ll be good right?Yeah, it’s no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]Can I ask why you’re leaving your current job?Is this a bad time to be doing this?Andy? You all set?So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?[to Gabe] Is it?Your department’s just you, right?Good!Yeah.Peepa.Great.No.You’re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.[pulls Dwight’s arm down] Okay. That’s vivid.Yikes.Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn’t trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?Okay.Thank you.Great.I’m sure it’s fine.Howard Cline?[checks sheet] Oh… Deshaun Williams.He’s an amazing man. He’s a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser…Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim’s desk and walks away]That’s very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?I think that’s probably all we need to hear from…That’s very…You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.No, not at all. In fact, I’m not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I’m just gonna pick a name out of the hat.Uh–Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.No, was it good?[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. “Soo-ven-yay.” Mr. “Jacques Soo-ven-yay.” Nice to meet you. It says here you’re French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.Assistant to the Regional Manager.What is it?Oh, that’s my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn’t hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That’s a travesty.[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you’re Dwight, and then… he’s the… [trails off][looks astonished] Ohhhh!This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, “just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.”Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.Um… why Kelly?Okay.Oh, I didn’t know you knew her?No.You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn’t a good fit.All right. Name.Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let’s discuss.Yes.Thank you, Dwight.Well, that was quick.He’s not a real candidate.You took the deal.That’s not okay.What is happening right now?No, why would you think that?Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.No, no, no. Not ever, ’cause that’s not gonna happen.Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I’m going a little bit crazy.Thank you.Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?[while sighing] I suppose I am.Yes.Okay.Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-Hey! Hey! Hey!What about Darryl? We can all agree that he’s a stand-up guy, right?What? No, no, it’s not a vote.I don’t know. This conversation really got away from me.No, they can’t. That’s not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We’re going in this room, we’re going to have a meeting. We’re gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she’s gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]",
    "Pam": "What are we doing?We need a new manager.[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?[looking at an engagement ring on Angela’s finger] It’s gorgeous, Angela.[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?That’s not accurate.How is this on me?Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.They’re the same picture.The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.And don’t say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.Did you see him at a bathhouse?The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.Forget it. I’m never gonna know what goes on there.You’re in the gay mafia.No.I’m a woman. I would want to know.She does seem happy.Okay.Uh, just put him through to me.Hello! This is… the client.Yes.Great.Thank you, bye-bye.That was our dream wedding.[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope… you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.No, I want you to say that you think the ‘best’ person to be our new manager is a homeless person.Ohh, hey Gabe, I’m sorry, we… we didn’t get you a cake or anything. We’re gonna miss you.[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?Well, okay!",
    "Kevin": "Um… Business!The Botanical Gardens, Scranton’s hidden gem. Don’t eat any berries you don’t recognize.Yeah! Tell us a story.Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That’s hot.We don’t tell her.[giggling, walks to Erin’s desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.It’s good. It’s just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me… but, if any kids are watching… A, B, and so forth. You know,… M-N-L-O, P… F…Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?Okay… well what do ‘I’ want in a manager?… let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do ‘I’ want?…So now anyone gets to talk at any times?What do ‘I’ want?… I’m looking for someone… who… [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]Later, man.Exactly.",
    "Fred Henry": "Absolutely–I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.",
    "Fred": "Yeah.Nice try.Well, I mean, I can’t just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you’ll get the plan.[speaking faster] Well, I’m not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You’re in paper, right?I guess I could be, if I was… who would do that?Tell you what. I’ll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.Color-code sent documents, TM.That’s a verbal trademark. That’s an agreement.No, I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of… [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.",
    "Toby": "I’m sorry, what is your three-step plan?[confused] W-What?How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?Uh… Human Resources.Yes.So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?Well, it’s one of my strengths, but it’s the manager’s job.Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?I’m sorry, if we did something to upset you, I’m sure it was inadvertent.I didn’t think you were.But there aren’t…Well, we could try him out for a little while… [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn’t work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in…No, no,… no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]",
    "Gabe": "Well… it’s an interview, and we don’t know that you really have the plan.How would we know that, if you don’t…Okay, I-I am, I’m almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]Oh? Uh… we haven’t started the interview yet. Were you–were you joking?Whoa! That’s a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.Well, Toby’s in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby’s done a fine job.I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he’s a rat, and I think he’s responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,… he broke up the happiest couple in this office!How many windows are there in New York City?Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.No… How far away is the Sun?Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just… [does a “wrap it up” motion with his pen]We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so… [nods]What do you want me to say? I mean, there’s a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to– okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?A little un-specific.How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?Okay.Okay, that’s not gonna be…All right.I have no idea.Very unprofessional, “Jacques.” Or, should I say, Dwight.How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a “zero” hand gesture]Yes, it is.Oh, Jo. Jo, I’m disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was…That sounds like a promotion![walks in] Gotta catch a plane.Oh, well I’m still the corporate liaison to the branch.Okay, you know what, you don’t need to make that sound.There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I’m a terrific hugger. I’ve been with a bunch of girls where that’s basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.",
    "Stanley": "[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don’t have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.My next boss will be my last boss. He’ll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim’s coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]I’ll get over it.",
    "Darryl": "Good morning.Good morning.I did.I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company’s owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn’t hurt that I’m… [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack![pats Andy on the back] Thank you.Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don’t see a bear drinking raccoon milk.So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]Uh… [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!I thought that was your job.I’ll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions… and consequences… of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl][noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who’s that?I… I just thought you knew me.Let me… [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave][on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say “Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was… [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.So, uh… here you go. [gives resume to Jim]Hope it’s all right.The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how’d he do?Ehh, that’s not who I’m talking about.Yes. How did he do?Come on man. I’m being serious. Don’t joke.Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.Paper material, ma’am.[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes][enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn’t disrupt your meeting.[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let’s go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin… especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.",
    "Phyllis": "[also to Darryl] Good morning.Did you have a nice drive in?Oh, I’m sure they’ll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky’s had come out.Mm.Yeah.Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?Bestiality. Yeah.If my daughter were asking me… [both giggle]I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,… go get them.I don’t think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.Is it true that you’re making Dwight the manager?He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin’s hair with her hand]No, we’re not related. I got the call. But… I’ll tell her some other day. [smiles]It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?Then what was this all about?",
    "Andy": "[puts up a poster in the break room with “IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY” on it in bold lettering]The manager job? Nah, I’m barely interested. I just can’t not go for it. You know, it’s not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.Don’t even… [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.In my family, you don’t really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don’t know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and… [awkwardly smiling] we’ll see what Rosa comes back with.[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.Okay, guys, it’s time. It’s pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.[grunts] Augh.For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here… [gets cut off by Gabe]I wasn’t acc-, accusing…Right! I really wasn’t trying to insult any, anyone.What?Okay. Let me think… are you counting car windows?[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and… [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,…[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!Hey, Erin.Where’d you learn how to puppet like that?Listen, I’m really flattered, but I don’t think we should.Erin’s my best friend in this office, hands down, but… when she asked me out, I just didn’t have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren’t there some things that you really want to like, but you just can’t… seem to like it, like, Mad Men… or football… [clips jumps ahead] Let’s not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I’m not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I’m sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who’s more… she’s great, though.Tuna… You’re completely sane.Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.She may have a point there… would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I’m educated. I’m capable. I like all of you… and I won’t make any changes.Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I’m about to do that.",
    "Erin": "[commenting on the poster] It’s good. I really hope you get it!Still, I’d really like to see this office with you in the boss’s chair.You in the boss’s chair![checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but…Yeah. I’m sure I was just another Porky’s baby.But why not find out.I think Andy should be the boss. He’s just so great. If I’m being objective, then Darryl, of course.[trying to cut off Phyllis] I… I don’t think I can do that.Well, that’s not my personality.Yes?I do really want him.[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He’s a burn victim.[motions toward her face] He’s all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!I’ve been turned into a puppet!I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!And there’s only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.A date with the best salesman… Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin’s desk][gets up] Oh.[shrugs] I’ve done it all my life.I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I’m standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I’m like…",
    "Dwight": "They won’t make me manager, and I won’t settle for anything less. I’ve gone about as far as I can here. That’s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.You can’t.No, it’s not.Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it’s made?[standing up] Get out.I’m gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That’s because I just threw it in the ring.[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How’s the family?Good. They good?What’s your daughter’s name again? Peepee?Peepa, how is she?Great! Oh, that’s great… We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?Now, listen,…Okay, I know why you’re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim’s throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.I’m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight’s Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam…Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]Fine. I’ll do it without you, but you’ll regret this.Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]Okay. [looks ashamed][clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I’ve learned so much from them. I’d like to be interviewed for the position.Okay.It’s complicated.[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.[again] Assistant Regional Manager.[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo… [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It’s me. I’m Dwight.[whispers] Yeah.I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you’d ever seen!Yes.Silence?Dwight Schrute.You have to interview me…I demand more questions!Okay! If you’re not going to interview me, then I’ll do it.What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and… [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That’s a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You’ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you’re gonna like the call you’re going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I’m just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]Well, it’s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone’s getting a little power-mad.What a surprise!

Naomi Judd?Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet’s Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, ’cause it’s so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator’s wife?Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim’s voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief][loudly] Stanley, I won’t be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn’t afford?Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream?

Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object… whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we’ve had already, you won’t be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?[more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do.

[gets on elevator][in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I’m gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I’m never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and… I’m gonna die here.You guys pay for relocation, though, right?Well, I’d want to move further away, you know? Just… I don’t want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.[pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I’m leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of ’em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just… I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]I’m having a bad time. [chuckles][continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.Honestly, I think I… I sabotaged myself. It’s like I’m afraid of being happy. Case in point… I was supposed to start another job today.",
    "Kelly": "Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.Well, I manage my department, and I’ve been doing that for several years now. And, god, I’ve learned a lot of life lessons along the way.Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.What was that?[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?I don’t have any, assh***.Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?Uh,… can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don’t worry, it’s not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it’s my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don’t think it’s professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I’m impressed.I don’t know, Jim, ’cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.Yeah, it was a great deal.I don’t know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.I’m sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I’m a singer, I’m a fashion designer.You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.I’m sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!I don’t care. They can just vote.",
    "Meredith": "[looks at ring, whispering] Wow…Tell us the freaking story!You pick a crappy boss, you’re responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]Yeah, you gotta know.I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let’s hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]",
    "Oscar": "Angela’s engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I’m horrified. As a friend of Angela’s, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I’m a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.Pam… I think Robert is gay.[whispers] So!?I have a very strong suspicion.What bathhouse?[confused, whispers] What?My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.You’re thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?Is there a front runner?Well, there must be someone who stands out.Well…Are you? [leaves]You have met a lesbian in real life, right?You’re right. You’re right. She seems happy. We don’t tell her.Erin, what are you doing?Okay. [walks away]I don’t think he meant, that–Go ahead.Can I say…?I think it should be Darryl.Kelly’s on your side.",
    "Ryan": "You guys, um, talking Senator?‘Cause he’s totally gay? [walks away]Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He “liked” my facebook photos at 3 o’clock in the morning.[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley… you’ll live forever…Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels… James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]I want an outsider.No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn’t see things the way we do, like a homeless person.No, you’re right, Pam, let’s just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?I got away with… everything, under the last boss, and it wasn’t good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don’t just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me… when I’m in the mood… to be led.Take care, man.",
    "David Brent": "[on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you’re looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don’t see things your way? Then I ain’t that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You’ve changed your mind? You’re now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]",
    "Nellie Bertram": "First, I’ll take down the cubicle walls.",
    "Nellie": "Symbol of transparency. There’d be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I’d take your job, but I’d reject the title.Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I’d do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody’s boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person… [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!Well, I’ll tell you how. Shall I? I’ll tell you how.By splitting the difference. Just… just, somewhere in the middle.Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That’s what I’d do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There’d be no desks. You just sit on the floor.You’ve got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!Sockee!… is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don’t, whatever, just talk to her! She’s a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you…you are cracking to go. [smiles]This job? Oh, yeah, I’ll get it. Jo’s an old friend. I think… I’m her best friend. She’s not my best friend.",
    "Jo": "[walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?Ohh, Robin was good. She’s always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard’s show though. [picks up resume from Jim’s desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah… a little long aren’t we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who’s had two jobs in ten years at one company?Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?Paper material?Or what? You gonna shoot me?I’ll interview you right now.Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?Yeah, but see… it’s not.Okay.Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo’s phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her “Dwight’s ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,”] Oh for god’s sake. He’s texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I’m roaming!Huh?No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn’t here in sixty seconds…Let’s just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?All that for this job.That’s f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.Okay, it’s fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who’s got ya excited?Who’s this fella? Went to Cornell. What’s wrong with him?And that’s your unbiased opinion.So it’s not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?Gabe…ugh… you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let’s get you back to Florida. We’ll figure out something for you.It’s not. Let’s get Kelly in here to take his place.‘Cause Gabe’s tall and weak. She’s short and strong. I’m doing an opposites thing.How’d my girl Nellie do?She didn’t mention it?Integrity move. I like it.Well, I’m not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who’s clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don’t mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.",
    "Jordan": "Who is our biggest client?[laughs] Okay.",
    "All": "[various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.",
    "Jada": "Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?I don’t know if he’d be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he’s a really great dad!",
    "Finger Lakes Guy": "[geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It’s just, the rest of my family’s in the Finger Lakes right now. I’m supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they’ll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.",
    "Pam as “fourth-biggest client”": "[in a comedic male voice] Hello!Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!",
