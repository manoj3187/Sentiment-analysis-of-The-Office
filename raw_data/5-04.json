Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.I was talking to myself.I just don’t get it.Why is she marrying Andy?That’s really fattening.Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that’s all we have.[Dwight groans] Ugh.Get in.I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.Are you sure that’s going to work?Wait, this isn’t our floor. Dwight…Listen to me close. ‘Cause I’m only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.

And Andy’s not really a risk.No, it’s lettuce.Where are we going?Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.I think it’s a fun idea.We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.Move on, Michael.It’s the only gavel I could find.Oh dear.Why couldn’t have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?Now you move on.Well Dwight, I don’t think you do.
